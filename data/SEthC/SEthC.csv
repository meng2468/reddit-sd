 Just hodl tight and trust that ETH will work out :)`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`If it ’s a choice between those two , I think ETH is the safer choice .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has flirted with the ATH so many times in the last few weeks that I literally do n’t know what the ATH is anymore or when we ’ll actually touch it .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`So wonderful to wake up and see that not only has the market not dumped but ETH has continued to do its thing !`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`

 I do hold a substantial amount of ETH for what it ’s worth .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Remember that time that the market was meant to crash because of CME ETH futures ?`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Oh maaan I thought ETH was at 1950 or something based on this comment haha .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is my second largest holding atm but I feel like this BNB pump has taken advantage of the fact that people have lost faith in ETH due to astronomical gas fees .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Makes me wonder if ETH is just going to stagnate for a little bit .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Do the coins just vanish into the ether ( no pun intended and it would n’t make sense if it was ! )`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`My rationale is that the BTC : ETH ratio is lower than it traditionally has been , and that ETH has gotten a bit of a bad rap due to the astronomical gas fees at present .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Everyone hopes that ETH will eventually deal with these issues ( rumours of upcoming EIP-1559 and eventually the entirety of ETH 2.0 ) and that when it does , prices will hopefully be more inclined to increase at that stage .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is a platform that allows dAPPs to function and competes in this space with projects such as Cardano ( ADA ) , Polkadot ( DOT ) .`

Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`You need Ethereum to use the Ethereum network ( ala paying " gas " fees ) and so Ethereum has inherent value .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`For this , you look at the total market cap of Ethereum - 250 billion - and ask yourself " Is Ethereum , the project as a whole , offering a solution to a problem that justifies this price tag " .`

 ( I agree that a rapid flippening would be a pretty scary moment though , even if I do like ETH better . )`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Probably unpopular answer but my heart says yes and my brain says no - the rapid rise in ETH stinks of FOMO and we ’re due for a correction .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Lol a few days ago when someone asked which would come first , BTC 60000 or ETH 3000 and i said BTC because ETH hitting 3000 is price discovery mode etc .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`They said Optimism was gon na be an ETH thing but apparently it ’s affecting VET too .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`A few months ago I stayed up extra late at night watching ETH crack its ATH from the previous bull run and celebrating with other folk here because my friends suck and do n’t know shit about crypto .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`“ Hey ma , I found Ethereum but cheaper ” 

 “ We ’ll go get some son ! ”`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Ahh , the classic “ ETC effect ” where people see “ Ethereum ” in the name and a cheap price and assume they ’re getting in early on a promising project`

Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Because the idea of getting Ethereum for cheap is very appealing for people who are new to the space and have no idea what they ’re doing .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`The general mentality being “ this is exactly like Ethereum , and was even the original Ethereum , but much cheaper and thus has more room to grow ” .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`This is of course mostly from people who have no clue about what Ethereum or Ethereum Cash are or what they do 
 2 .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum cash being one of the available on Robinhood , meaning that many riding off the Doge wave might have another project in close proximity to invest in with their Doge gains .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`I think if you ’re gon na go all - in on something then it could be much much worse than a solid project like ETH !`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s an outdated version of ETH that gets most ( if not all ) of its value from having Ethereum in its name .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`If you ’re going to pick from the Robinhood premium curated selection and think that BTC and ETH are too expensive , can you at least get LTC instead of the other rubbish ?`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`I think your decision to buy ETH over these is wise ( although given the irrationality of the market it would not shock me if ETC pumped more in the short term )`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`It is a project that is dead in the water and is living off having “ Ethereum ” in its name whilst being significantly cheaper .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`I think BTC and ETH are fairly important to understand the basics of , and not too taxing on the brain .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Is there anything more correct than ETH going upwards ?`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Wow just woke up after sleeping for 12 hours and ETH did the thing again .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Doge gains going into ETH is an outcome I think most of us can be perfectly content with I think .`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`Was just gon na say , from your description it sounds like another hedge against ETH with a much smaller market cap and better staking rewards , so could be decent !`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`I generally dislike the anti - American sentiment in this sub ( ala the “ Americans woke up and dumped on us again ” trope ) but i mean , ETH finally hit 4 K when the east coast went to bed right ? 

 !`
Hotdogbitchface,favor,Ethereum,`No one can predict with any accuracy how high ETH can go in the next 5 weeks let alone 5 years`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`This has been my rationale for years and has continuously left me baffled as to why people keep talking about how BTC is n't competing with ETH - if ETH is a superset of BTC and ETH is superior in their overlap ( faster , cheaper transactions ) , what purpose does BTC serve ? " Store of value " ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;How do you expect a crypto like ETH that touts to encompass the decentralized finance system do something like this ? 

 No matter how many times I read this I come to the conclusion that you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about 

 Reading your comment history makes your intention clear ; what 's sad to me is that someone who is so vocal on something has absolutely no idea what he is talking about - have you deluded yourself into thinking you know this stuff , or are you just insanely dishonest ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;original fundamental thesis for something completely different , so yes in that sense Ethereum is far more centralized than bitcoin 

 How does active development mean it 's " far more centralized " than bitcoin ... ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`For all practical purposes Ethereum is completely decentralized ; saying anything else is just tired bitcoin fud 

 Also dapps are n't a " risk " to Ethereum , they 're a consequence of Ethereum being programmable ( and thus infinitely more useful than BTC ) .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`The thing you describe as a " risk " is actually the primary selling point of Ethereum and why BTC is becoming totally uninteresting from a non - speculative perspective .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`If you process transactions differently than other people who process transactions ( i.e. go against the rules ) , you lose some of your locked ETH , incentivizing you to do exactly what everyone else does ( i.e. create valid transactions ) .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 does n't matter if it 's intended to be if it has all the properties of currency ? theoretically there is n't much reason to have anything other than ETH because it 's essentially a superset of all other crypto ( barring layer 1 tradeoffs that I may be unaware of ) , assuming it can scale to meet demand`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 I love how no matter what ETH does , there 's a hot take from a bitcoin maxi about how this is negative .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`For years now bitmaxis have been touting " INFINITE SUPPLY " as a huge negative of ETH ; the moment it 's addressed , suddenly it 's a bad thing .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 But I can see why you 're scared ; suddenly ETH might have more allure as a " store of value " ( which is the biggest bait and switch in all of history btw , what an insane copout by the BTC community ) , because now you get paid to stake , the issuance is negligible / potentially deflationary , and organic demand drives up price .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`The problem is that bitcoin maxis had no rationale behind being maxis ; the negative connotation has no reason to extend to Ethereum because it 's general purpose - if it can do what everything else can , but better ( barring layer 1 trade offs ) , there is good reason to be an eth maxi 

 Wish the crypto community would stop with tired platitudes tbh`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 I 'm sure there are ETH maxis who are maximalist for no good reason ( presumably that 's what you linked but idk ) , but there are justifiable reasons to be ETH maximalist , meaning being ETH maximalist is n't * inherently * the same as being BTC maxi ( there is no legit rationale for that )`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm not even speaking to " negative / toxic " behaviour , I 'm speaking to the concept of being maximalist , and how being ETH maxi and BTC maxi are not the same , because BTC maxis are inherently holding an irrational position 

 I guess we are talking past each other`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 This can only be ignorance or disingenuity on your end 

 & gt;Ethereum is promising technology but is far away from becoming THE ONLY blockchain that matters ( ... ) 

 If Ethereum is a superset of 90 % of other blockchains , you can easily make the argument that they serve little to no purpose .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`In terms of scarcity you 're about to be dethroned by EIP1599 , and for all practical purposes BTC is not at all more censorship resistant than ETH - any other narrative is just a BTC meme 

 But that is n't even what I 'm saying ; I 'm saying BTC is absolutely futile as money , because only the wealthy can afford to use it`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`reality : totally abandon the spirit of the whitepaper / the crypto community by post - rationalizing new narratives like store of value to prop up price 

 reality : BTC and ETH wealth distribution is basically identical 

 reality : BTC is not more scarce than ETH with EIP1599 

 I have * * never * * seen a BTC proponent make reasonable arguments regarding ETH , * * ever * * , in the 4 years I 've been invested in crypto`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`He comes off pretty salesman - y to me and always has ; do n't just gobble up anything he says without skepticism 

 I 've hedged a bit so I do hold some ADA in these trying times ( gas lul ) , but I just do n't believe that he miraculously solved all the problems the collective Ethereum mindshare ca n't - certainly there are tradeoffs , and I have never ever heard him talk about any of them - which imo would grant him more legitimacy than the " we 're just better in every way"-salesman rhetoric`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 It 's low risk for him to say this ; the game is not about claiming to solve all crypto problems immediately ; he profits from painting the picture that ADA & gt ; ETH - do n't mistake him giving a bit of rope as him being fully truthful , it 's just a rhetorical device .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`Imo he actually comes across as extremely calculated and I would never have bought a single ADA if it was just from listening to him talk - I just hedge because the amount of ETH FUD narratives are through the roof and I expect some ETH market share to spill into " competitors " for now .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`  there is nothing to gain by * * not * * being " down to earth " and " community - oriented " ; do n't let yourself be manipulated so easily - he is never this honest when it comes to comparing ETH to ADA .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 & gt;But I find it risky to update to POS while working with POW 

 afaik this part is essentially working ; why do you deem there to be a risk ? gut feeling or an actual reason ? 

 & gt;Another risk I find is that really high fees will make dapps move to other platforms 

 They may in the short term ( until sharding / L2 adoption ) - but if I understand the lay of the land , ETH is the project doing the heavy lifting when it comes to L1 ( and L2 ) scaling with the best set of tradeoffs .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`I wish Charles would talk about this openly , because it 's almost impossible to grasp what is going on without very intensive research that is out of reach for most people including myself - the fact that he does n't and purely does negative spin on ETH makes me distrust him automatically .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`It 's not so much hate , it 's more misrepresentation and colorful interpretations / analogies ; like " we 're faster " ( without saying which tradeoffs ADA makes to scale ) , " we have onchain governance " ( without mentioning the cons ) , " ETH is an experiment " , " We market to developing nations " ( like ETH is n't able to penetrate that market ) , " We build on granite " ( as opposed to ETH being a mess ) ...`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`A lot of talking the project up , but never being truly transparent about the cons - the transparency and ethos in the ETH dev / research community is so easy to follow in contrast ; there is no front figure running a huge marketing campaign that I just have to trust blindly 

 & gt;This is why I trust research based and slowly but securely developed products .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 I have literally never seen him give any ground in terms of ADA not being better than ETH on any particular meaningful issue , so I 'd be happily surprised to see this`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`in principle there does n't have to be a significant # 3 or # 4 if ETH can scale to meet demand - could just be ETH , and then a bunch of niche blockchains with different tradeoffs 

 difficult to guess what will happen , so I hedge a bit in DOT and ADA`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`It 's an extremely common ETH FUD and culling it could influence price .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 Because literally nothing Vitalik has done indicates he is in it to " profit maximize " - how bad of a character judge can you possibly be ; perhaps this just tracks with your endless crusade to FUD ETH , and it has nothing to do with Vitalik 's alleged nefarious motivations ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 & gt;You're the one making the extraordinary claim that he 's somehow " different " , rather than assuming he 's just the same as everyone else . :) 

 He does not present himself in any way that would indicate he is here to squeeze more profits ; in fact he seems fairly empathetic with a strong ethos - much like the ETH community as a whole - a sharp contrast to narrative you are creating , which is why I *`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`You have yet to proof this is happening , which is a really fucking tall order , because it implies conspiratory - tier collaboration in a very transparent development and research process , and it does n't at all track with the Ethereum ethos .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`I mean , I could literally go on , Ethereum has a long history of these things happening * all the time*\--but people like you just turn a blind eye to it because " when moon " .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`Or they 're just practical , understanding that Ethereum eclipses Bitcoin 's use case while also performing better in their functional overlap ( especially given ETH 2.0 )`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 I care about ETH adoption ; I would never - and I suspect most of the community agrees here - be in favor of reduced issuance if it compromised the protocol .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`I 'd wager & gt;90 % of ETH investors think this way , but you have an ingrained bias ( or you 're a straight up manipulating , ca n't tell ) causing you to incessantly FUD ETH in ways that are blatantly contrary to reality , like claiming we 're all greedy moonboys shilling to enrich ourselves .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`The fact that they sold some of Ether to users does not mean their proportion of ETH did n't increase relative to user - held ETH . 

 & gt ; It 's funny that you say " we need rewards to secure the network " while also being in favor of cutting net issuance to 0 :) Those two positions are contradictory .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`the fuck 

 & gt;A lower price makes it easier for new users to buy in , 

 No ... fuck me , I ca n't believe you 're still going on with the high ETH price = high gas fees .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`I mean , are you really arguing that dollar - denominated fees go * down * when dollar - denominated costs of Ether go up ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`You literally * just said * :   
 & gt ;  
 & gt ; Now you 're claiming that if the dollar value of Ether goes down , the ether value of transactions goes up ... which would be that magical linkage you 're claiming does n't exist .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`Your argument is " there is no historical data " , but that is not evidence , that is failing to understand * * why * * people pay more fees when the price is high , and there are very natural explanations for this : 1 ) higher demand means more congestion 2 ) bullruns make shitcoin trading extra profitable , creating a monetary incentive far outweighing the fee cost 3 ) gas fees do n't adjust instantly ; if ETH doubles in $ -price overnight , the gas fee is indeed higher short term , but since people will pay as little as they can get away with to get transactions included , as congestion drops , the fees will follow .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`Knowing this , how can you believe the price of Ether dictates the price of fees ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`we all know that ETH is n't ready ; we are n't buying for what it is now , we 're buying for what it 's becoming ...`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum is built for users ;   validators are paid only by necessity , and by that extension should be minimally rewarded .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 Let 's be honest , everything he says on ETH vs ADA is embellished .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`This is such a nothingburger ; there are multiple “ eth cofounders ” who are going in a completely different direction than ADA ... but he ’s the best one , or how do I interpret your argument ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`you do n’t give a fuck about Ethereum if you ’re seriously asking for charity at the expense of users ; mining is not a job - it ’s an opportunity you can take if you like the profit margins - you do n’t get to decide to pay yourself more , because the design goal is minimal issuance for security`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`If you start doing dodgy shit it will be resisted by devs , researchers and users - I understand * * why * * miners are doing what they do , but that is not an excuse . 

 And as someone with first - hand insight into how the EF works , I can tell you this ecosystem is * * packed * * with and led by people who actually care about the technology , so calling me naive is really just calling yourself ignorant of what Ethereum really is`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 & gt;Here is a question for you : do you think the crypto ecosystem in general ( Ethereum included ) has a greed problem ? 

 In general yes , Ethereum less so .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 I wonder how many hoops you have to jump through to logically connect this question to miners trying to extort Ethereum ; again , I understand * why * people are greedy , but that is literally not the discussion , so again , not relevant`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 this is just a definition game 

 if ETH has the same properties , but then * also * has other factors driving price up ( i.e. actual demand ) , then all else equal ETH is a better store of value`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`You saying an ETH holder who mines can lean on the fact he holds ETH to argue for more money for validation ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`this whole debacle is framed in the context of miners extorting Ethereum ; the actual implication is that when someone says " fuck miners " , it is directed at those miners , not at all miners ( because why the fuck would someone blanket hate miners who are n't doing anything unreasonable ? )`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 I glanced your through comments because I 'm curious why you 're opposed to EIP1599 , clicked on your channel , and saw a " Sold all my Ethereum " video in the catalogue 

 Not really worth a non - meme reply when you handwave " look at my old posts " , and then I do , and it 's just you getting schooled by some guy on EIP1599`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;baseless accusations 

 how is it baseless when you literally have a video 1.5 months ago titled " I sold my Ethereum " - not about to do extensive research before I post a meme reply to some dude who is n't even engaging 

 & gt;And there is no " I sold all of my ethereum " video on my channel .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`" I sold my Ethereum " can reasonably be understood as such , unless you mean you literally sold 1 Ethereum`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`You : Ethereum ca n't exist without miners 

 Me : Ethereum will always have miners due to how the incentives are designed ; implication being that miners are entirely replaceable and any individual miner is not critical to the survival of ETH 

 You : 1 + 1 hurr durr 

 you can see how I think you 're a bit slow , ye ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`& gt ; Ethereum is not implicitly plural , it 's a network protocol .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`I sold my Ether would be no different .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`literally everyone here knows ETH is n't ready for mass adoption and accept that we are n't ready 

 being an ETH proponent is being a proponent of trying to solve the scaling issue ; contrast with BTC proponents who manufacture post - rationalized narratives to cope with the fact that it 's essentially vaporware`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum has high fees because it has users ; if your alternative has the same problem under load , what solution did you even offer ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`And if it does n't have any problems under load , what compromises have they made to get there ? 

 The reasonable explanation is that nothing can compete with Ethereum mindshare ; empty marketing talk and narrative - building is worth nothing`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 Surely designing a protocol from scratch ( Ethereum ) without the limitations of BTC / BCH protocol design is better than attaching smart contracts as an afterthought , so I 'm not sure why you 're touting this as a strength 

 & gt;Building a decentralised application layer to work on top on bitcoins peer to peer electronic cash .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 Not really interested - too many purported Ethereum killers and it 's always the same - I do n't even remotely believe BCH can compete with Ethereum despite what some marketing website says ; i.e. have n't heard a peep about sharding , proof of stake , rollups , etc . on any Bitcoin variant - it 's a non - starter`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`He did not say or mean that you ca n't do puns or have fun , he is saying if that is * all * Ethereum amounts to , then it 's for nothing`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`Disregarding the fact that you unironically believe ADA is ahead of ETH ... 

 How are ETH scaling solutions half measures ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`

 See for me the writing has been on the wall since early 2017 - there is no serious competitor to ETH .`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`Every time a " rival " comes up I try so fucking hard to understand what the technical reason is for their proposed " scalability breakthrough " , and it 's always the same : huge decentralization compromises and no load ( i.e. zero adoption / users ) 

 Ask yourself how miraculous it would be if some random small team beat the collective research and dev effort in the Ethereum ecosystem 

 I fail to see how it 's not obvious to you , but maybe you 're just not that intuitive`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`& gt ; Why would anyone want to support ETH with people like you backing it ? 

 nice rhetoric , actually got dumber reading this and you 're +15 upvotes 

 how brigaded is this sub ?`
CreditMaterial,neither,Ethereum,`but how is this an argument ? if Ethereum is a superset of BTC there is no need for BTC - it 's an if , but it 's not even an unreasonable statement and arguments can be made that ETH is a better store of value , nullifying any use case BTC ever had`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Speaking of CKB , why did you decide to get it @ at what price did you got in ? 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 Great to see ADA and ETH at a high % .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`CAKE is solid , people will be using it as long as the ETH gas fees stay high .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I assume it needs ETH to transfer it ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I read that it uses ETH gas ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`It 's the year 2031 

 Bitcoin has reached $ 15Million 

 Ethereum has reached $ 800 K 

 Stellar is still a stable $ 0,40 coin`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`The only 2 choices with minimal fees were XRP & amp ; Dash , all other options use the ETH network thus require a larger amount than what I wanted to convert .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`$ 174 cause I expect a big dip to money flowing to ETH after breaking 2k .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Remember when ETH dipped when grandpa BTC fell down ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Also many things require some ETH to move , so holding it wo n't hurt you ar all .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`My predictions for both bull run & amp ; bear market : 

 BTC bull : $ 120 K / bear $ 8k 

 ETH bull : $ 7 K / bear : $ 350

The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`BTC got ta take a look at ETH , he keeps making new ATH 's !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Ca n't wait to see ETH hit $ 2500`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`ETH keeps edging the $ 2500 , soon it will explode 💧 💧`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`ETH doing great , congrats to all the holders 🥳`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine if ETH hits $ 3k , from there it will only take a few weeks till it reaches $ 5K. Do n't get me started on the race to $ 10k & gt;!(easy to do in a few months)!&lt ;`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Of course the profits will be lower than investing in some cheap alt , but the chance that an alt gets a nasty dip is way higher than ETH doing that .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Wait , you 're saying that ETC wo n't beat ETH by doing a flippening ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 Either the DOGE pump continues or people will dump that shitcoin and get themselves some ETH now it 's below $ 2500 ( that 's the dip ! )`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 I just hoped why would use their profits on better projects like ETH , XMR , VET , etc .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine if someone asks your biggest mistake ; 

 " I sold my ETH for DOGE at $ 0,50 , not DOGE is worth less than a penny and ETH is above $ 8k "`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Money flows out of BTC , ETH , XRP into DOGE , people cash DOGE out and money is out of the crypto space .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH is a low risk & amp ; medium to high reward project .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`You mean really live and not of if those " send 5 ETH and get 10 ETH back " fake streams ? 

 Ca n't imagine people sending 10 K worth of ETH to " Vitalik " himself , lol .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I am really hoping that some coins will decouple from BTC and go their own way , ETH & amp ; XMR deserve that .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I remember when people said that ETH was a shitcoin for staying at $ 1300 ( after dipping from $ 2k ) .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's go ETH !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`ETH gon na edge that $ 2799 sell wall so hard that it will blow up to $ 2850 in a single minute . 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 $ 3 K ETH end of week ai n't no joke .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`$ 2900 ETH EOD will be a fact soon , Hell even $ 3 K would be very possible .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I am starting to believe we will see $ 5 K ETH before July . 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 Pamp it !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I guess it 's safe to say that the moment ETH hits $ 3 K it will shoot up sky high so hard that it wo n't see the € 2 K range anymore .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 I think it will take 2 minutes once ETH has hit $ 3 K`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone else is having a raging hard boner from looking at the ETH chart ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's be honest , $ 3 K ETH is like 10 % if it 's actual value 

 PAMP EET`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Guys , I am still erect from seeing ETH breaking the $ 3 K sell wall !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 They will be dammed happy to see that we did n't dump but actually pumped ETH to + $ 3 K tonight .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I hope ya'll made some good ETH predictions from the last poll .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 I would n't doubt that ETH will hit $ 3500 before EOW`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's go ETH`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I see   ETH comments , I upvote , it 's that easy cause I am in a good mood .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`* ETH breaks big sell wall 

 ETH : Want to watch me doing that again ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I STILL HAVE A RAGING BONER FROM WHEN ETH HIT $ 3 K !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`IB4 ETH gon na do a +50 % today 

 Anything is possible , right ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`My finger is hurting from upvoting the ETH comments !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I truly believe that ETH will hit $ 5 K within 2 weeks .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I guess ETH will go so parabolic once $ 5 K has been hit .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Guess it 's safe to say that ETH has decoupled from BTC ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`My dick is still erect from ETH hitting $ 3 K !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 What did you invest in ? 

 BTC , ETH and many others are having a healthy grow with a dip every then and now .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`It 's basically the " safer " cryptos with exception of ETC , that coin is the " poor man 's ETH '`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Remember , $ 4 K ETH is closer than $ 3 K ETH`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I see ETH comments , I upvote .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH is doing it 's own thing .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't want to see DOGE flipping both ETH and BTC .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 2 : ETH is here to stay , no new coin will be created .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Holy fuck that ETH pump 🥵`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's go ETH !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`ETH made me wet , how about you ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Uhm ....... how is ETH a Ponzi coin ? 

 Do you even know what 's the function of ETH ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I honestly start to believe that $ 1 K will be possible before ETH reaches $ 4K. 

 I mean , smooth brained retail investors wo n't see the difference between the two .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`$ 3800 ETH ! 

 Let 's go to $ 3900 and then the big $ 4 K !`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Do n't lie to me , ETH breaching $ 3900 made you wet , did n't he ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine ETH hitting $ 5 K within a week 🤭`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone else still hard from ETH hitting $ 3k ?`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Remember that $ 3 K ETH is as far as $ 5 K ETH .`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`

 Also , imagine ETH at BTC price , 0.16 ETH will be a lot`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I gon na buy 10 bucks worth ETH , then we hit $ 4K. 

 You 're welcome 😎`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`Quick , someone buy $ 15 worth of ETH , then we will hit $ 4 K`
The-Alcoholic-Seal,favor,Ethereum,`I just realised that ETH has hit $ 4 K , actually it even has hit $ 4168 !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`This sure is a mad market but Amazon at least starting to understand ETH is still very bullish for all of crypto imo`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is gon na do incredibly well with the burning mechanism going live soon 😊`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I bought some ETH just an hour ago and left more free money on the side for a dip but I think I 'll have to go against sound logic and go all in my guys 😳`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`That s why you never sell Bitcoin or ETH .`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Chilliz and ETH making their hodlers proud today 😀 🚀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Same .. Had to double read the name to make sure its not Ethereum or something 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah have n't considered Ethereum to be an altcoin for quite some time now tbh`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah , the Ethereum gas fees are really making it hard to transact on Uni these days though ..`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Its insane how much we need ETH 2.0 to happen !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`In the next year or two I 'd guess ETH wo n't dump below the 1k mark as its getting too valuable .`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Did anything new happen today that I might have missed except for the unfortunate Doge pump and fortunate Ethereum one ?`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I 've been saying for months now that ETH under 2k is free money 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum deserves to be much higher than 2k , this is only the start !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm at work but just had to login quick and say how much I love Ethereum and LTO .`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Did he ever say how much ETH he personally owns ?`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`The deflationary measures are really gon na help ETH pump to new heights !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I should go sleep as its 2 AM over here but the ETH pump that is incoming is making me run circles around the neighbourhood naked !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`You can still easily trade your ETH on exchanges and I do n't think the big whales that really move the markets care if a transaction costs them $ 5 or $ 30 either honestly ..`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`We need Bitcoin and Ethereum to pump more for that to happen though ..`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`My Samsung keyboard autocorrecting Ethereum tells me we are all still early ! !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`VET and Ethereum making their hodlers proud in this mad day we are having ! !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`That being said I 'd look into buying some more Ethereum , LTO and VET now.m`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Funny dog went brrr but lets see Ethereum go towards a new all time high now 😀 🙏`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Let me fatten up my ETH stack real quick before we attack 3k ! 🚀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Let me wake up at 50 cent VET and 3k Ethereum please ! !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`As you said plenty of people use Ethereum daily and they need ETH to do those transactions .`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`They see its got Ethereum in its name and its just cheaper lol`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`It depends on your trading strategy and wishes then , if you want safety go with BTC or ETH .`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`BNB , UNI and Ethereum making their hodlers real proud today !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`That 's risky but could pay off as long as you think ETH is gon na outperform Bitcoin going on`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`VET and ETH go up - I buy ! 

 VET and ETH go down - I buy !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Altcoins - ETH , VET , ALGO .. 

 Shitcoins - DOGE , BTT , TRON , JST ... 

 Hope you see the difference buddy 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Let me get some more VET and ETH during the dip !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't see it happening until companies like Tesla start buying Ethereum too tbh`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is cheap even at that price honestly .. 4 - 5k is more adequate right now`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`ETH and BTC making us proud today , hops for a new all time high soon enough 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Buying Ethereum feels like stealing from the rich lol`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`ETH still has a lot of quirks and they are working hard on fixing them and progressing more 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`The admins have told us they are developing a whole layer 2 solution on Ethereum specifically for Moons so that could take some time now ..`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum , yes as I actually think its going much higher .`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Hey buddy , start by buying some Bitcoin / Ethereum and seeing how it all works .`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`♂ ️ 

 People have said it compliments Ethereum and then tomorrow they say its a competitor ..`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`And Honeyswap too if you would like to avoid the fees as there is a pretty easy way to dodge the costly Ethereum bridge by using the AscendEX exchange 😊`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`

 From a crypto perspective it has to be BTC and ETH ( both are fantastic investments too )`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I like that lol ! 

 In all honesty though , I like to joke about ADA and their lack of smart contracts but a proper competitor to Ethereum is always fine by me as it makes both do better 😊`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Split between BNB and ETH , stake both and watch the gains pile up !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Its definitely going there are Reddit has partnered with Ethereum with specifically that in mind buddy 😊`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I think those are the coins this sub loves most along with BTC and ETH that have both done well lately too 😀 🚀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is definitely going where it wants once we hit 2.0 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin has satoshis , Ether has gwei ..`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Love to see Ethereum consolidating so well at these price ranges !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Probably due to Robinhood and them having Bitcoin and Ethereum in their names lol`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Lets get Ethereum to 9k so we can start referencing Vegeta memes once again ! ! !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Dex is the best but we need ETH 2.0 and lower fees to really make it great in that sector 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`The thing I could trade my Moons for an Ethereum and I am not doing that only proves how much I trust Moons .. or how plain dumb I am 😂`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Buying into Ethereum is n't even FOMO as we all know its hitting 10k sooner or later !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm scared of where the Ethereum price could go once the burning mechanism goes live lol`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`As my grandpa said while fighting the Axis powers in WW2 " Keep stacking Ethereum guys " !`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Going home from work now , please keep my Ethereum safe until then 🙏`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`The funny thing is that could never happen with Bitcoin or Ethereum 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`That 's just what ETH does tbh`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Let me get another Ether bag ! 

 Ca n't get enough of it as the burning mechanism is getting launched soon 😀`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`VET , ATOM and ETH making their hodlers proud these days 😀 ❤`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`That 's how you avoid the hefty ETH fees`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`Staking in 2.0 will make ETH much more stable 😊`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`I believe it does as Moons are on Ethereum anyway`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`By doing it this way , you also avoid any Ethereum mainnet fees`
Hame_BiH,favor,Ethereum,`That 's why they are creating a whole layer 2 solution just for their Reddit coins in partnership with the Ethereum foundation ..`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`So not a bad idea if I plan on holding ETH until 2024 at least .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's pump BTC and ETH !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`If the updates go smoothly I can see ETH hitting 20k in a few years .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I disagree , I think Bitcoin and to a lesser extent ETH are past the point of crashing to nothing .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I hope ETH goes beyond this galaxy 🚀`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I ca nt wait to see where the upcoming updates take ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I did n't see ETH hitting an ath before BTC .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`All we know for sure is ETH has a ton of potential !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Just being conservative , I 'm crazy enough to believe ETH could be 25k in a few years !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Do you think it would be worth buying over investing into BTC and ETH ?`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`But ETH has an update coming that will burn a little of the currency each transaction which could lead to it being deflationary .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I do nt believe BTC or ETH will see   50%+ drops anymore , who knows about the rest of the altcoins though .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I believe BTC will never be under 50k again and ETH will stay above 1500`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Its not a terrible investment but you would most likely make more by just purchasing BTC and ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I m so pumped for 2.0 I think ETH has a great future ahead !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I question if there is a better investment than buying BTC or ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Real talk , I think BTC and ETH will always bounce back higher after a crash .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm glad I have ETH and BTC .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`both seem promising , I usually just get more eth though because it feels safer .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`This is why most of my portfolio is BTC and ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`After seeing BTC crash from 58 to 43 and ETH from 2050 to 1300 nothing gets to me anymore .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Doge is having its day but btc and eth will likely be in a much better spot in a few years .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`This is why I always recommend BTC and ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I would have to suggest ETH . amazing returns this year and I think it has a lot more potential with the big updates coming soon`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Every time I 've bought stocks and compare my gains to btc , I always come to the conclusion that I would have been better off buying BTC or ETH`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Hold ETH , I ca n't say much about xrp and I have never heard of reef , you probably want to let that one go .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Watching eth out perform btc the last few weeks is what it is .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Hard to say if ETH will dip back to 2k any tone soon or even ever .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I always recommend first time buyers getting into BTC and ETH to start and expanding from there .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`You messed up by not having more ETH in my opinion .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`So I wish I bought more ETH and less BTC over the weekend dip .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I agree and with the blackout in China it shows a flaw in BTC that ETH will not always have .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`It has so much potential and with great updates coming I see a great future for ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I feel sure that BTC and ETH will bounce back , so I 'm not regretting mostly just buying them .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Because I want a good hedge against inflation and I believe BTC and ETH will increase in value over the upcoming years , plus I believe in the technology behind both`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are what I recommend since they have proven themselves and both use impressive tech .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd suggest buying the big two and expanding from there after doing research or just keep stacking BTC and ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Check out BTC and ETH . sure they wo n't do a x5 in one week but they are much more sound long term and will outperform doge in the end .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Agreed , it helps me to invest in things I know have stood the test of time like BTC and ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I think BTC ETH ADA is the way !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH make much better long term investments , dogecoin is like a slot machine .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`ETH , if you can even consider it an alt coin anymore .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I think investing in both BTC and ETH makes sense .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Just when I think Ethereum could n't look any better !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Seeing a good team behind ETH helps me believe there will be a bright future ahead for Ethereum !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I am personally more excited for Ethereum with how much potential it has .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`It will make sense to invest in ETH in 3 years even !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I m regretting buying even a small amount of doge , it would have done me more good to just get more ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are like investing in gold and oil 40 years ago .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I would say any time is a great time to buy ETH , this will be considered cheap one day .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Who knows though , ETH has so much going for it right now .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has so much going for if that it 'd be wise to get what you can while it 's still below 3k , I do nt think it 'll be in the 2000s for much longer .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Do n't put your life savings on what is the next btc or eth killer because that probably is n't going happen .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`For instance I also believe ADA has a bright future but its more risky than ETH in my opinion .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`Can someone explain the difference between what ETH is doing in Africa vs what ADA is doing there ?`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`People also need to consider that one day BTC and ETH could be right around the same market cap instead of one taking the lead by a huge amount .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I think this cycle may be different and ETH and BTC may never be this cheap again .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I doubt ETH and BTC will ever see drops like that again`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`It 's only fair BTC has a better day than ETH . that has n't happened in a long time !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`No matter how small , keep stacking that ETH !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I wonder what ETH will be in a months time ?`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm mad I do n't have more ETH mostly .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`BTC is letting me down lately , I regret not transferring more of mine to ETH .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I just wish I invested more evenly between BTC and ETH . still I 'm very bullish on both !`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I was thinking of selling some of my BTC to get ETH but I think Bitcoin will have its time to shine soon .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`It 's great seeing ETH do so well but I want to see BTC doing great too .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has so much going for it that it should see steady growth over the next decade .`
Jasond777,favor,Ethereum,`I more so mean that waiting for a dip with ETH has n't been worth it lately .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Can someone please explain what ETH 2.0 means to someone who already owns a little ETH ?`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Look I believe in ETH as much as anyone but let ’s be honest it ’s not moving near as much as LTC .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`BTC drops 3 % and ETH drops 6 % been happening for days now .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Run ETH run !`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone see this going sub 30k BTC and sub 900 ETH ?`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`So yes that ’s a taxable event but if ETH goes down and you end up making no profit you do n’t get taxed on that original $ 300 profit`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Lots of reason , but first let me say I still hold ETH .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Agreed that ’s why I hold ETH , but you have to admit DOT is looking good this run and it has a lot going for it technology wise .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Looks likes shorts got in on the ETH action heavily .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I love ETH but I do n’t think it was on the list`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`On their latest purchase I thought I read ETH was n’t on the list .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Got my ETH buy orders in for 1050 and 1000`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`It might take minutes and it might take days but I feel like Bitcoin is going to 28k and ETH to 1k then the bull will resume like nothing happened .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`It says “ please connect to the proper Ethereum network ” but when I go to my Trust wallet it says connected .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I own ETH and hope it moons ( no pun intended ) but those gas fees are outrageous .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s be honest until ETH2 comes out ( which could be years ) ETH is a speculative price .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`No you do n’t need to have 1 whole ETH but my human psychology wo n’t allow me sell any because I have round numbers and as soon as I do it will pump .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 being tested for staking .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 being tested for staking on Coinbase and gas fees are low`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 is being tested for staking on Coinbase and gas fees are down .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Until ETH 2.0 comes out this project is it ’s own worst enemy`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Easily going to 200 but with ETH gas fees being outrageous I could see it going a lot higher .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`When people realized ETH gas fees make it all but unusable`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is my second biggest holding behind BTC because I believe it will be fixed before next bull market but short term those are better bets IMO`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Problem with BTC coming down is ETH will too .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH is the future but at the end of the day improving my stack takes priority .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Yes but Bitcoin went from being money to a “ store of value ” “ gold 2.0 ” ETH ’s whole meaning is to be used .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I understand there are solutions in place but until they become widespread buying ETH right now is speculative`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m not a hater of ETH I just do n’t believe this bull run is the bull run of ETH`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I agree 100 % I think ETH is the future but for right now there are better plays out there and when the dust settles and I ’ve made my gains on those other plays I ’ll be back to ETH in time to ride it to the moon and beyond with 2.0 .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I appreciate your detail led response and I definitely wish ETH all the love in the world .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I understand it ’s an ERC20 token on the ETH blockchain but that does n’t seem right`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone know how I can get ETH from the main ETH network to the rinkeby network in my metamask wallet ?`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`My guess is now is a good time to load up on ETH because once they fail the price is liable to rocket`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`With all this ETH talk I feel it needs to be mentioned KCS has quietly gone from $ 5 to over $ 7 in two days`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I think maybe ETH would be second place .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Why do I this feeling that Tesla Added 800 million in ETH and once earnings are released the news will drop ?`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Wallstreetbets finally allowing BTC , ETH and DOGE conversation .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`A lot of people think it ’s a cheaper ETH which is a bit funny`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH will be the next big major acquisition .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I think once ETH 2.0 comes out BNB wo n’t be as good an investment but that ’s likely years away so you ’re good holding BNB for a while`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I want ETH to flip BTC just as much as anyone but people saying it ’s finally happening are being naive to say the least .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m hoping he added ETH`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m guessing ETH is doing well by all the comments`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Remember with people were complaining that ETH was a stable coin ?`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t worry you ’ll have another chance to buy sub 1k ETH when BTC inevitably shits the bed and does n’t come back till next halving cycle`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH gas issues were n’t a thing I ’m convinced ETH would be 10k by now .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`ETH , BTC and BNB are probably your top 3 can invest and forget about in that order .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Well below where we are but with ETH hitting ATH it would be nice to see DOT doing something similar`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Your comment was about Bitcoins energy consumption and we admit that with layer two solutions ETH and Bitcoin could handle the global economy like the the legacy banking system .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`So with Bitcoin and ETH using a fraction of the energy consumption that the banking system uses how does comparing the two energy consumptions favor the banking system which uses 10x more energy ?`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I think the general census is ETH 10k in here .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Most certainly but the tricky part is at some point we will be able to load up on sub 2k ETH when the crypto winter comes`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Amazing that Trevor Lawrence turned his entire 23 million signing bonus into BTC , ETH and a few shitcoins .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Look I believe ETH is the future but everyone in here needs to understand that Bitcoin is still king and without Bitcoin this bull run is over .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I believe ETH is having a standard ALT pump .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Until ETH 2.0 comes out layer 2 solutions are the only reason it ’s still usable on a small scale and let ’s be honest you need a masters degree to figure out how to do that .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Everyone saying they wo n’t go mainnet until ETH 2.0`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I ’ve made some posts about how the whales will most likely put money back into ETH and BTC .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`You already have if you own ETH`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Just DCA’d some more into ETH after taking some profits on some Alts`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I have two friends that already sold their DOGE gains and put it in ETH after realizing somewhat of what they are doing .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Because someone is new to crypto and thinks it ’s ETH`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Personally , I ’d leave it in BNB until we have more info on when exactly ETH 2.0 is coming out but honestly either play is a good long term play .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has more upside once 2.0 is out`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`I think that whales would have billions of dollars to pump into legitimate projects like BTC and ETH .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`The theory still stands that if DOGE crashes the whales will pump money into ETH / BTC and other legitimate projects .`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`The majority of my stack came pre December 2020 but I decided to add another whole ETH at 2k and I was convinced at the time I fomo’d 😂`
SailsAk,favor,Ethereum,`Up to you but Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) is where the smart money is at .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I really like Benjamin Cowen youtube channel , he have lots of videos about BTC- ETH relation .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`It 's looks like it 's a good time to buy ETH , in all the last years , ETH did a strong move against BTC around this time of the year ( mid December-`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I think it 's temporary , I really hope ETH will make it move soooon !`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH / BTC is at it 's lowest .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I hope ETH will brakes out soon !`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`People were saying buy only bitcoin and there is no reason to buy ETH , I 'm glad I did n't listen !`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`It 's just started , ETH / BTC is still low , my plan is to take profit beck to BTC , but I think Alt season just started .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is just started moving , I think we still have some time to enjoy before the endgame ...`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Support is building , hopefully ETH will be able to hold the 1k this time !`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`

 For example , up until yesterday , ETH / BTC was extremely low , so invest in ETH to get more BTC later , was a great thing .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`He want to sell when ETH get to about 1400 , that this is it 's old ATH .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`What I 'm trying to say ( it 's might not come out right ) that during this bull market , if he had sold his BTC when we got to 19.5k which is the old BTC ATH , he would have missed out the run all the way up to 33k . 

 So instead of selling all his ETH when we will get to 1400 $ , maybe it 's better just to take some profit but keep the majority , because we most likely going to hit new ATH afterwards .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Consider maybe at this time put a bit more in ETH or other Alts that still have room to grow .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I think the comment above was n't familiarize with staking ETH on kraken .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Is it normal that a month ago I felt really over exposed so I sold some so I wo n't stress as much ( at 19.6k which was really good at the time ) , and naw I kinda fill under exposed and thinking to buy more ETH ... ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`

 Also check about staking , specially ETH , Ada & amp ; Dot from that list .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm thinking of selling because I 'm thinking ETH will outperform LTC , but it 's taking me a while between thinking and actually selling ....`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH is about to make a big move hopefully up .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's BTC chill out first , that ETH will explode !`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`They are speculating that Alts will recover and move first and after a good run they will buy back to ETH thay will start moving .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`It happened before- BTC goes down , BTC get steady , Alts move , ETH move .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Both Ada and moon are up , ETH is down , buy the fear - ETH will raise again ...`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`AVAX , LTO & amp ; ETH 

 But I just hope everything will moon in the following month !`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Many of new people in the market did n't even herd of ETH before digging in .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Is it to much to ask for BTC to just chill , the dominance will keep going down and we will finally can get our Alt season followed by a big ETH move ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`He posted a bet a month ago that if ETH hits 2k , he will do a giveaway of 20k moons between everyone that tags him on the daily discussion`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I hope litecoin will raise , but it just underperforming so far , it 's not even gaining over BTC or ETH .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`All of those have lower fees for transferring than BTC and ETH .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Things to should check : if those have pairs with ETH BTC or other coins you want to buy , so you do n't need to do an extra trade .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Do you still think ETH is a shitcoin ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I really wanted to watch ETH brakes the 2500 , but it 's just to late and I need some sleep .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`At this time I would go with ETH , it 's a bit behind .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`

 Yes it pumped now , but generally speaking , BTC and ETH perform better .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`It 's can pump from time to time but I think BTC and ETH are better long term .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`So we are ok with ETH going up 11 % in 24h , but we are freaking out if it dip it ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`By the time you will finish playing with paper trading and realized it , you could just buy some BTC / ETH and hold them to make profit .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Is anyone else looks at the ETH BTC charts and thinking we are getting close to a good point of switching some ETH to BTC ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I have my ETH bags full , almost 50 % of my portfolio , I should balance some back to BTC soon ...`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I was about to go to sleep , but I see you ETH !`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm planning to do sell some ETH when we will get about 0.05btc if not on this round I will wait for the next lol`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I think the BTC / ETH is almost at the pick .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm about to switch some of ETH to BTC because of this .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`They keep going up and down , now ETH is up so I think it 's very risky to switch to it now , wait when it 's back at about 0.03btc`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I find it 's funny because I 'm waiting for a little more of pump from ETH before switching some ETH to BTC .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I expected ETH to perform better than BTC , why take the risk otherwise ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are my main holding ( about 60 - 70 % ) , then I have about 4 " bigger alts " about 20 - 25 % , and than some 11 moon shots or dust from transaction the rest with really low % each .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I think it 's important not to look just on the charts of the coin / usd rather then coin / btc and coin / eth .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`How high do you think ETH will keep gaining over BTC ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Give it a few more weeks and they will appear again when ETH will chill at 3k for to long ...`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`You ask and in my opinion as the market is TODAY I personally will pull out of ETH and not BTC .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`It 's up 6.5 % in 24h , ETH is up only 4 % .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`

 One recomendation that I think is importante is to look on charts really zoom out ( monthly candles ) and look at the coins in comparation to ETH and BTC and not in comparation to usd .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Shower thought : Is ETH / BTC price move the ETH / USD price or the other way around ?`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I think he promised a moon giveaway to anyone that tags him when ETH hit 3k`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I like that ETH is just casually chilling around 3100 like it 's no big deal .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is a great long term hold , do n't strees if it 's dip on it 's way to the moon .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`All eyes on ETH , once it will come down and chill , Alts will explode .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`But I 'm holding longer to let ETH do it 's thing first .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`My last move was in December from Btc to ETH , 0.02866 I want to see if I can double the Btc lol .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`BTC might start moving again soon , I 'm not sure how this 0.053 will hold , I might start DCA from ETH to BTC as it 's goes up .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`She is looking at what ETH does and waiting for her tern`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Stay level headed and do n't think ETH will flip BTC anytime soon ( maybe in 10 years ) .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`It 's funny , the more people are talking about selling BTC for ETH the more I want to do the opposite because probably the top is coming lol`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is just pumping now , so do n't panic if it will dump to chill at some point .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm guessing that this bull run is in the middle and there 's between 2 - 5 X more to go , both on ETH and BTC .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`The way I think it 's optional to DCA is to look at the ETH / BTC chart - right now ETH is really high , so I would put bigger Chunk of the money this month / week on BTC .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`They think it 's a cheaper ETH .`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you look at DOGE chat you see it had some big spikes against BTC ( no as big as this one of course ) 

 If you look at ETH chart , it is in a general up trend in the last two years more or less ...`
PinguinaUshuaia,favor,Ethereum,`Many coins including ETH done over 10x in a year , BTC did about 6x .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Right now ~$2.3bn funds are deployed farming UNI , with $ ETH being the reference token .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`This means that there is currently ~$1.1bn ETH locked up , about to be released into the wild .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Where do you think that ETH will go ? ”`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`

 Commercial farmers loaded up on ETH to capitalize on UNI rewards and when they end , it is likely these farmers will offload their ETH as well . ”`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`“ Commercial farmers loaded up on ETH to capitalize on UNI rewards and when they end , it is likely these farmers will offload their ETH as well . ”`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`

 I think we will see some influx to ETH 2.0 staking , but as the article suggested there ’s a lot of commercial farmers that are likely going to look for other farming options .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I think what he means to say is that ETH will explode soon`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`They will , I remember I bought some ETH at 130 $ or something in 2018 .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Lmao imagine going to the store and asking the cashier “ can I pay with Ethereum here ? ”`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I can afford to miss it though , I already own a significant amount of eth and btc`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`It could either be that there ’s no Rinkeby ETH left or too many people are claiming at the same time .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`It is , on behalf of their customers they ’re acquiring so much BTC and ETH .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`What worries me most is the total radio silence on the Ethereum scaling bake - off , it ’s been months since the last update .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`they have to get more of that ETH , otherwise transactions wo n’t work .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is decentralised , they are n’t selling anything .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I do n’t think he ’s going to send you 1 ETH`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`There ’s nothing wrong with Vitalik owning 219 M in Ethereum , there are probably larger whales out there .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Tether at 20.7B market cap already , at this pace I see it overtaking ETH in a year`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`When ETH pumps you know your shitcoins are next`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH chart looks very similar on the monthly compared to BTC , ETH is just 1.5 months behind .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I would suggest to start with ETH or BTC before going into lower cap altcoins .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I already explained in the comment before why it ’s different for Bitcoin and Ethereum .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is used a lot for building coins and a lot of other stuff I already explained .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`The only coins I do n’t consider alts are ETH and stablecoins`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH was $ 80 in March , what you talking about ?`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`

 BTC and ETH are n’t thriving because of XRP , maybe XLM is though .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`“ ETH miner balances are at an all - time low , hinting that there is seller exhaustion ” Was the part that got me most excited![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|to_the_moon )`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`There ’s dozens of coins that have claimed that , none have been gaining the same attention as ETH so far`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`It is what it is , I ’m hodling my ETH strong !`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah fees are insane , I have n’t moved any of my Ethereum based coins since the fees skyrocketed`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`What a rollercoaster it has been holding Ethereum , maybe even more than just holding BTC .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is like a car , it needs gas to do something .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Proof of work needs miners , and they charge you fees for sending the Ethereum .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I heard Reddit partnered with Ethereum , hopefully they do n’t abandon Moons and start over`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I think most normal users with 1/2 ETH are providing liquidity now .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`You can use Airswap to unwrap your ETH , guide is here : https://support.airswap.io/en/articles/3550521-wrap-eth-and-unwrap-weth-on-airswap`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`You ’re obviously talking about my Ethereum post that got 6 K upvotes , and I find that ridiculous too .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I think it ’s just tesnet Ethereum you get for free`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Every time I refresh my portfolio ETH increases my balance`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`In short it means there ’s less and less people selling their Ethereum , meaning the price will go up faster due to less liquidity available`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Will they even use any options from the Bake - Off now that they partnered with Ethereum ?`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`It seems like just another L2 solution for Ethereum , what makes it special ?`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Convert to fiat or a stablecoin is what I do , I know some convert to BTC or ETH but that ’s just reinvesting .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I definitely agree with that , I made an “ ETH hit ATH ” post when it reached 1600 $ and got 6.2 K upvotes .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I would got maybe 60 % ETH , 30 % ETH , 10 % alts , I think Ethereum has more room to grow`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`With Ethereum 2.0 it will remain on top , they just need to hurry up as competitors are catching up ,`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Long term I think there ’s more gains to be made holding Ethereum`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH address is visible , but spitting through that to find someone is at least harder .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Sold some of my ETH to get myself some plastic surgery after wanting it for years , excited and scared at the same time`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Especially ETH made me big bucks .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is n’t getting shilled that much anymore since fees have exploded , it ’s just price talk now`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`They ’re the real Moon token , they ’re wrapped through multiple bridges to get it on ETH mainnet`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t know for sure if it ’s worth it , I think you need to pay ETH gas fees`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Depends on how much you buy and how you deposit on Bilaxy ( direct deposit , sending eth there or sending a stablecoin there ) .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`It used to be very simple , nowadays you have to think on how to avoid ETH gas fees`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I tend to disagree , an established name like Ethereum wo n’t just fade away if competition is better .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`If they fix the gas fees at least temporarily I do n’t see why ETH would go away`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`“ Ethereum is going to crash ” , yikes I hope not .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`So I have 3 Coingecko NFT ’s , I ’m taking bids starting from 10 ETH`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`u / Altsaretrash still convinced the bullrun is over and ETH wo n’t hit $ 2000 ?`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Quite often , people criticised Ethereum for fees , ADA for being kinda useless rn , Nano for being spam attacked , Bitcoin for being slow / expensive etc .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Maybe ask on r / Ethereum or r / NFT to help you further , I ’m currently laying in bed`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`NFT ’s on Ethereum are a waste of energy , PoW is outdated technology .`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`They think it ’s Ethereum but cheaper , in a bullmarket people buy anything`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Because retail thinks it ’s cheaper Ethereum`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`They ’re printing 1 - 2B at the time now , at this rate they ’ll take over ETH in a few months`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Maybe that was the case in 2015 , nowadays ETH , DOT , UNI , LINK , VET all have way more usecase than the meme shitcoins`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`This makes me happy ETH being my biggest holding :)`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`I have a problem with the Automoderator , 3 times my ETH post got removed due to some “ 4 posts ” rule`
SweetPie123,favor,Ethereum,`Because there have been ETH killers for as long as I can remember , and all failed .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum is a smartphone , it is a general purpose platform to do anything and anyone can create new applications for it .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`We do n't know what the rewards will be because they decrease as know eth gets staked .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Half of that is more likely if num eth staked gets into the millions .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`If you can wait until rocket pool is ready you can stake with amounts like that plus a centralised entity wo n't control your ether so it 's better for you and the network .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Lol why do you have such a fetish for taking about eth , it 's all you do .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Eventually it will be replaced by alternatives with better properties , like long term security guarantees even with lower issuance , and enough bandwidth to safely let everyone transact , and no awful PoW. Like a ZK roll - up on Ethereum 2 .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Saying it does n't matter because it 's a long time away is like saying ether has a maximum supply cap because it wo n't be exceeded for a long time .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`None with a significant market cap are close to doing as well as ether compared to their ATH , but it also does n't make much sense to compare to ATH because one massive run up in the past will dominate it .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`It also gave up on being permissionless so ca n't really compare to ETH or BTC`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`

 So it 's likely the total supply of ether will begin decrease while bitcoins will still be increasing to incentivise mining , and the 21 million limit was a mistake by the creator which will have to be undone .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`ZKrollups with all the security of Ethereum are running right now and are free to use , the high fees are only relevant when moving into our it of them .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Long term scaling is no issue for Ethereum due to rollups .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`It 's like using a CEX but with the benefits of Ethereum .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`It 's changing rapidly and Ethereum is somewhat pivoting to focus L1 on being the best zkrollup base layer it can be as eventually everything will be a zkrollup when the tech is ready .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`You use it just like Ethereum , send in assets to the contract then you can use them in the roll - up .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Zksync is a contract on Ethereum , and they run a service which you interact with when transacting in the roll - up .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Everyone wants 1559 except some idiot miner that thinks mining is a goal of Ethereum rather than a temporary necessary evil .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`That day is not coming 

 Data sharding , or what used to be Ethereum 2 phase 1 , will be live in about a year and is relatively easy now that the beacon chain is live .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`With data sharding and 100k tx / s by 2022 the attraction of any alternatives will be gone , can they flip Ethereum within the next 12 months ?`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Their problem is they are all competing with each other to compete with Ethereum which makes it hard for any of them to get any real network effect .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`With both running Ethereum will handle 100k tx / s , there 's no need to give up security .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Because of his greed and trying to change projects to make himself rich he was kicked out of bitshares , kicked out of Ethereum classic , then made iohk as a for profit closed company which scammed japanese investors for seed funding .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`There are dozens of clones of Ethereum ideas which are further ahead than ADA , with better decentralisation than DPoS and without it 's centralised single point of failure development company .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`You 're better off buying ether`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Bitcoin is n't really relevant to this , it 's Ethereum which can replace it .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Rollups have scaled Ethereum to thousands of tx / s now .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Do you realize all scaling methods for btc work for Ethereum too but none of them are pursued ?`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Because they 're pathetic in comparison to the properties rollups have which are only possibly with Ethereum level expressivity .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Not really , moons / eth was 1000 % higher when I sold compared to now .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`And this sub is dead , for Ethereum discussion look to r / ethfinance`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`With scaling solutions immanent there is no need for other chains , they will just be less secure and have less network effect than Ethereum .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Ada is just the latest shilled Ethereum clone , there were many before and will be many after it , it will go the way of EOS and the other DPoS bullshit .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Charles was kicked out of Ethereum very quickly for trying to make himself rich by making the Ethereum Foundation a for profit company rather than a non profit .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Iohk began shortly after Charles was kicked out of Ethereum for trying to make himself rich instead of making the Ethereum Foundation a non profit .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Xdai is less secure than Ethereum because it 's only DPoS like ada but still more secure than etc which has a low rate and uses the same hardware as a bigger PoW chain .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum is all in on rollups and their plans revolve around them now that it 's been discovered how good zkrollups can be .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`I remember Charles from his days at bitshares and early Ethereum so I know he has zero integrity and is only in this for money and ego .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Great thing about rollups is the UX actually gets better , it 's like using a CEX but with all the benefits of Ethereum`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Metamask has millions of unique monthly users and you can interact with Ethereum state in a rollup for virtually free .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`They 're exactly what Ethereum needs and have somewhat obsoleted execution in shards .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`See [ https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698 ) 

 Another thing you 're missing looking at the EF website for future plans is the wrong place to look , Ethereum is decentralised , if there was one organistion saying this is what 's happening it 'd be a lot more concerning .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`They 're not distinct things , there 's only one Ethereum .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`The reason I first was interested in Ethereum was the potential to improve aggregate efficiency in the world , that 's the only thing that truly improves things .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Long term bitcoin will fail , Justin Drake talks about some of the issues here [ https://youtu.be/ycK3AUTdl1w?t=6857](https://youtu.be/ycK3AUTdl1w?t=6857 ) so I do n't really have any desire to hold BTC over ETH .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Yes ADA is clearly overvalued if you assume ETH is fairly valued .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Not sure if there will be any value in having any more networks than Ethereum .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum development will never end , there is no single upgrade which is 2.0 .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Optimism had the most attention and no token , they use eth which is the best thing about it .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Optimism uses ether whereas zksync will use it 's own native token so the investors make money .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`The L1 fees are negligible to VISA and if they wanted to transact more frequently using an Ethereum zkrollup lets you do thousands of tx / s for basically free and keeps all security and decentralisation .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`He convinced the Ethereum Foundation to sell a portion of their holdings and it has all gone towards research and development , he publicly announced doing so and it was a great idea , it meant the EF sold none during the bear market so more r&amp;d per eth .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`As I said a lot of that has already gone to many charities and developers , do you think they all want eth or dollars ?`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`They probably have the slowest development of all crypto projects , still no smart contracts 6 years after Ethereum had them is a joke .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Remember on very little budget Ethereum launched with contracts within about a year .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`You know both bitshares and Ethereum kicked him out due to his character ?`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Remember Ethereum launched with smart contracts even with a small team and little funds in about a year even though they were innovating the whole idea .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Wait is n't that * exactly * why he was kicked out of Ethereum ?`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Already solved , you can transfer eth in a rollup like loopring for basically free with no compromises .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`The difference is Ethereum never rolled the chain back , no transactions have ever been reversed unlike Bitcoin .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`There will be decentralised staking pools like rocket pool which are simple to use , so Ethereum gets the benefits of PoS and it 's easy to stake small amounts without the big downsides of delegating that you get with EOS and ADA DPoS.`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Yes if a node operator intentionally attacks the network and burns their own 16 eth I think that 's right .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`But so long as it 's ready before the merge and before the beacon chain is used by Ethereum that 's fine .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`They can vote in contracts to add new strategies , may end up making even more ETH .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`They can vote in contracts to add new strategies , may end up making even more ETH .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`" Ethereum ’s proof of work consensus algorithm utilises relatively slow and inefficient brute force computation and the combined effort of all network nodes can only generate one block at a time .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`This is why the Ethereum network can currently only reach speeds of around 16 transactions per second " 

 That is so backwards`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`It 's much bigger now with so much real use and locked up ether I do n't think we 'll see a drop that big for eth this time around .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`If you can include searching Ethereum dex transactions it 'd be awesome .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`That 's why he invented rollups and sharding which can increase capacity 100000 times above the base 55 transfers per second Ethereum does now .`
Stobie,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum for example intentionally sets the attitude of not taking things too seriously and being open to considering new ideas from the top which moves the whole community 's characteristics as different types of people are attracted to it .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`new to crypto here , just realized the ridiculous amount of gas fee for eth and their chain , with the xrp needing no process of mining , why is nt it has more adoption ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`new to crypto here , just realized the ridiculous amount of gas fee for eth and their chain , with the xrp needing no process of mining , why is nt it has more adoption ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`the gas fees are crazy and furthermore , i need to deposit eth first which double the cost .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`new to crypto here , just realized the ridiculous amount of gas fee for eth and their chain , with the xrp needing no process of mining , why is nt it has more adoption ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I thought eth is the safe bet`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`it hurts when other are pumping but eth stayed , is this what bear market feels like ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has been stagnant for 3 days , is this what bear market feels like ? ? ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m receiving 184 % apy for staking so i just turn all of the rewards from that into btc and ether and it ’s stacking up fat ! 

 Hell yea ! we hold the same bag bro`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`well . nvm then , lets just say i am very bullish on eth`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`try staking on Kucoin , they allow exchange of Eth2 / eth so you can always unstake it for a small fee`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`comparing ETH to ADA is like comparing Apple to Foxconn , One deliver promises the other deliver the product`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I think I need to stay away from a 1minute candle , that drop on ETH 4 minutes ago ( only a measly 1.5 % but it looked like a massive candle on 1 m chart ) nearly made me have a heart attack and burst my tits right through my shirt .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; NY 

 for it to be low they need to move from PoW to PoS which only will happen on ETH 2.0 , there is no other way around with the amount of demand for ETH Network and how bloated it is`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Bought ETH at 2400 and panic sold at 2330 thinking it would dip further , of course it will bounced right back .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`panic sold eth at 2330 thinking it will dip further just to fomo rebuy at 2400 .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`BTC may not hit $ 300k but my dog said that Ethereum will hit $ 4k by summer and a slight chance for moonshot $ 6k 

 not financial advice but my dog is my financial advisor`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`This is a wake up call for everyone investing too heavily on alts and forgot about ETH and BTC .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`and yet ETH outperform BNB today , I wonder why`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I feel like ETH just want to break free but BTC keep on dragging it down`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`BTC ruined the ETH momentum , was hoping it can break ATH but BTC decided otherwise`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`come on ETH , I know you want to break free from BTC leash .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`panic sold eth at 2330 thinking it will dip further just to fomo rebuy at 2400 .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has been pretty amazing is n't it ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I thought ETH run yesterday marks ALT season but it seems like we have to wait for a little bit longer`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`you would think with the current Ethereum gas fees exchanges like UNI would tank , guess what ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`So , correct me i d I 'm wrong , ETH killer is supposed to be DOT and ADA right ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Is it true that ADA and DOT CEO are from ETH founder and they used ETH code in their tokens ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`He is mad because people start to think ETH killer is actually a real thing 😂`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`to be devil 's advocate , this ETH price pump cause gas fees to become higher 😂`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH barely dips anymore , often it just blip and pump .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't see why ETH wo n't replace Bitcoin in the foreseeable future`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`lol , hell I can just buy 100 % ETH and I am sure the etf gain would be close to my investment`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`To think that last weekend Ethereum briefly dip into sub 2k , man time flies really fast in crypto world`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Where do you eat when you hungry ? 

 Ether - y 

 Okay I am sorry that was n't funny but still bullish on ETH 💸 💸`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to break 0.05 BTC / ETH mark ! !`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH preparing to take off , next stop is ATH ! !`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`oh my god , look at ETH green dildo , ETH does nt care that BTC decided to dip`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I would guess that most exchanges are really depleted in terms of ETH`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`be careful guys , I just bought ETH at this price , you know the drill :(`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH below $ 3k is still a buy for me ! let me have all of it`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`the only thing holding UNI down is ETH gas fees , once it is settled , sky is the limit ⛽`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`waiting for ETH to dip is like waiting for snow in July .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I have about 20 ETH stuck on my metamask wallet .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I have about 20 ETH stuck on my metamask wallet .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`who said ETH gon na stay and see everybody else mooning ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`idk about that , kinda tough looking how strong ETH has during dips`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`omg ETH keep on going when everything else is sleeping , what is this power 🤯`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`it 's crazy to think Ethereum never use any $ $ to do their marketing .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`it 's crazy to think Ethereum never use any $ $ to do their marketing .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH holding stronger than BTC means everyone have huge faith in ETH future and its growing ecosystem 😊`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`come on ETH , I know you want to cross $ 3,000 .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`that 5000 ETH sell wall on $ 3000 is yuuuuggeee , lets break it .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Vitalik just became a billionaire after ETH hit $ 3,000 got me excited because I can also be a billionaire soon !`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`I meant seriously , how can anyone argue ADA is better than ETH ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`is n't it weird everytime ETH pump I see no ADA shills ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`they usually said ETH is dead and ADA is the future 🤔`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`people said ETH were dead last month when it goes sideways for weeks , I guess they bought ADA 🙃`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`okay ngl , was exhausted because of that ETH Pump 4.0 but now I 'm primed for ETH Pump 5.0`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH / BTC ratio looking strong only means that Eth can no longer be considered alts`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Vitalik only own 333,000 ETH which might be a lot but in the grand scheme of things is a minuscule portion of the whole supply , so IDK what you are saying about`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`notice how people said last month that ETH is dead and ADA is the ETH killer but it is nowhere to be found now`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`oh man , not really a good day for alts , ETH and DOGE pump it bleeds , the price corrected alts also get corrected , now ETH and DOGE pump again ? ofcourse alts bleed again`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`hmm interesting , but for example I put ETH and Tether at 1800:1 and now the price of eth is already 3300 with no sight of going back down .`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`yeah but I read it is just better to hold if ETH will appreciate in value , thanks for the info`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETC is poor man 's Ethereum , okay ..`

andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to break ATH 👀`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Why Ethereum classic have to follow Ethereum price movement ? does n't people know they are different ?`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is a beast , it held stronger than btc during this dip ! 🤯 🤯`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Come on ETH , I know you want 4 K`
andrewhartanto,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum not stopping , love it`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I think eip1559 and l2 will lower fees and crucial moment will be switch to eth 2.0 .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I hope you are right , I feel eth price will go up fast after eip1559 .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I 've learned that the hard way , when I was too scared to buy vechain at 0.008 $ and I invested in eth .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Depends on your life situation and whole market situation , but for me : 

 eth around 5000 $ , I bought for \~150 - 200 $ 

 TRX , starting from 0.25 $ 30 % of portfolio , rest keep to at least 0.5 $ 

 Ravencoin , waiting for halving , I will start selling around 0.7 - 0.8 $`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,` 
 After eip 1559 eth inflation will decrease and eth 2.0 will encourage staking which will lead to higher prices .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I recommend rvn , after eth 2.0 and rvn halving this coin will explode .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH road to 2400 $ LET 'S GO !`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's good , but it 's dependant on eth(if eth 2.0 goes faster , bnb will decrease )`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Also bnb is doing good , because of horrible eth fees`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I would stick to btc / eth , we do n't know what will happen in next   5 years , not to mention 15 + years .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm not selling rvn , accumulating it towards halving and eth switch to 2.0 .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is still undervalued , because of horrible fees .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Finally eth going better than btc`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Missed moon distribution too , but eth price make me happy asf`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm so happy while being both eth and btc hodler .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH was so undervalued , ETH gains are coming this year`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`So close to 2500 $ , eth let 's push`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Yesterday I was talking about 0.045 eth / btc , now we are going towards 0.05 .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`If it 's not worth to mine for you , just buy eth instead of paying more for electricity bill`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH was undervalued for years , l2 and eip1559 are good indicators of eth being even more useful(lower fees ) .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's literally skyrocket now ;) 

 Buy ETH after dip , good coin for long term hold`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH to the moon , let 's pump it`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Ether is really strong now , I wonder how it will go in next week .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH rising so good , vet is going slowly back too`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I was loving eth for 4 years , soon we will skyrocket ( eip 1559 , l2 , low fees )`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Moon boys , let 's go , eth showing strength`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Big number , it helps ETH rising too , so good for us`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's good as long ETH have problems with fees , main bnb usage is bnb smart chain .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I hope , ether can do this in recent form`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Nice , make sure you buy in next months ETH`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Maybe if you think long term exchange ETH for BETH(6 % at start ) and stake it on binance for around 7 % apy .`

Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH rocket to 3300 let 's go`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Exchange to xlm , send xlm to other exchange and buy eth then`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`If you need money or feel ETH wo n't push so fast , just take some profits`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`It means more people bought ethereum on exchanges and withdrawed to wallet compared to people who sold eth on exchanges .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum ready back to attack and destroy 3200 $ wall  
 EDIT : That was so fast :D`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Good to hear , eth made me biggest gains of all investments in my life :)`

Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`$ eth , let 's go to 3400 .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`I hope I will wake up to 3500 $ eth tomorrow .`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH gang hodl and do n't panic sell , we will go back to gains soon`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Nice ETH going back above 3400 $ , let 's go !`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's go ETH , I like it`
Norbit11,favor,Ethereum,`Friendly reminder for everyone having good GPU , make sure you mine ETH / ETC / RVN for free crypto everyday ( for example 10 $ everyday for rx 5700xt ) .`

epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is by far the leading platform that has taken 6 years to get to where it is .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Temporarily the price of ETH would crash for sure and BTC and ETH copycat fans would be all over it , but in the end I just do n't think it would really matter that much .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`It greatly improves how gas is paid , and it will result in ETH becoming more scarce because ETH that before went to miners as transaction fees instead will be burned .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 One of the key things that people speculating in the value of Bitcoin has criticized about Ethereum , is that there 's no hard cap on inflation like on Bitcoin where there never will be more than 21,000,000 .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has a steady level of inflation around 5 % right now , but when EIP1559 goes live , Ethereum could end up having a negative inflation , making it a better vehicle for speculation .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Funniest thing about this is Ethereum has proven itself over and over again , it has been live and running with smart contracts for 6 years , it 's been through ups and down and it 's securing billions upon billions worth of transaction , but everyone is talking about it like " who knows if ETH 2 will ever happen " like it 's a real possibility even with all the research basically being complete and phase 0 having launched and running .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`The only thing that 's obvious is that you do n't understand the first thing about Ethereum , you 've gone and fucked up and lost your gas money in a failed transaction , and now you 're trying to blame the network .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`By owning Ether , basically owning a share of Ethereum , or Ethereum processing power .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't know if these figures are still correct , but here you can see how the return is affected depending on how much ETH is staked : https://miro.medium.com/max/1250/1*Nq66dFrvgQoXCHLpipvEiA.png`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`It promises to be better than Ethereum , but it does n't have smart contracts , it uses an unsecure version of PoS called delegated proof of stake , and it does n't have any users , many of their blocks are completely empty .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;BTW , if you guys know any job or someone that is paying in ETH 

 I would recommend that you learn solidity programming language , that 's very high in demand and you 'll be able to get some jobs that pay very well in ETH :)`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`I checked out his posting history and he claimed that Ethereum was n't designed for smart contracts and that became the " narrative " in 2019 like .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`People who believe inflation is the biggest enemy to their wealth often criticize Ethereum for having a steady level of inflation , and use this as an argument for why ETH ca n't be considered a " store of value " .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`These people often exaggerate this point to a ridiculous degree , claiming there 's an " unlimited " or " infinite " supply of ETH , when in reality there 's a limited steady level of inflation .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 But because of how the Ethereum ecosystem works , ETH is actually an excellent store of value , probably even far superior to BTC .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 A lot of security on Ethereum hinges on ETH being locked up as a stake to secure the network , or as collateral against which you can take out a loan in stable currencies and earn interest in DeFi .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Transaction fees from the network are going to get burned instead of going to miners - this alone is likely to make ETH deflationary practically speaking .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 So the TL;DR of the TL;DR is , ETH demand greatly outpaces the supply , making ETH a great SoV. EIP1559 means ETH will get burned , and probably become deflationary .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`The Ethereum devs ca n't force something through without the support of the community and the community would never back them up on increasing the issuance .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`ETH first experienced being in crazy demand from the ICO boom , then it came DeFi which keeps locking up more and more ETH , and who knows what else will emerge that 's going to demand for large amounts of ETH to be removed from circulation .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`To me those are exactly reasons why ETH is a superior store of value , it gives ETH intrinsic value .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`If you want to understand the effect of the issuance rate , you should stick with this chart : https://etherscan.io/chart/ethersupplygrowth 

 ETH block reward was reduced from 5 to 3 ETH at block 4,370,000 and from 3 to 2 at block 7,280,000 .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 It 's true that ETH issuance is more complicated than BTC , but it is by no means complicated or unsound . 

 & gt;As far as devs and community parts , has there ever been a major resistance that devs lost ( apart from etc split , which again was not a loss ) ?`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Here is Vitalik 's main wallet for instance : https://etherscan.io/address/0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b 

 Secondly , where PoW offers an unfair advantage to people with access to ASICs first and people with access to cheap electricity , in PoS you simple need to have some ETH . 

 & gt;Now I do n’t want to be a conspiracy theorist 

 But you are speculating .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`I have n't kept up to date , but for now I think all staked ETH is locked until phase 1.5 .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 With Rocket Pool it 's different , when you stake your ETH you immediately receive rETH which you can trade or sell or use immediately .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`If the delivery is never made , is that ether presumed lost ? 

 The ether will remain in the contract until the conditions for a payout is met , or until it 's withdrawn by the sponsor , if that ability was written into the contract .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`A lot of the so - called " ETH killers " who offer high TPS at the base layer are making assumptions like " this level of security is probably good enough " instead of building robust systems that are provably secure .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`That sounds kind of like plasma cash , something that was designed for Ethereum but I do n't know if anyone ever developed it .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Right now Ethereum looks like the best bet for scaling it in the near future .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think ETH will hit $ 20,000 in 5 months , but it 's not because " $ 20,000 ETH would mean $ 2.3 trillion market cap that ca n't happen because Bitcoin is only $ 1 trillion " .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is becoming the first blockchain platform to really break through and people ca n't even begin to fathom how big it 's going to be .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 People who do n't follow the things coming out of Baseline probably do n't know this , but Ethereum is getting integrated into SAP and Google and Microsoft applications , as a sort of consensus layer in between that allows direct communication and interaction between the biggest most widely use enterprise software solutions .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 Here 's a normal ETH transaction between 2 accounts 1 minute ago : https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc26238fcfe81ca5cb8525bd451431d511a712395950184e77186f037e24424e8 

 He paid $ 4.72 , which definitely is a crazy high amount , but transferring ETH between 2 accounts is not $ 80 that 's just absurd .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are by far the largest and most used platforms , and they are the only platforms with serious interest and use from the " real world " at this point .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum 's ecosystem is huge and it has taken Ethereum 6 years of being live with smart contracts , and the most developers and attention to get to this stage .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`The nearest competitors are n't even live with smart contracts , and frankly it does n't make sense to think they can get farther than ETH faster , with fewer developers and less research .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Could you list some of the reasons you think it 's better than Ethereum ?`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 Then there 's Ethereum , the obvious best performing platform of any in this space , with a demand for ETH that 's going to greatly outpace the supply , in effect making it much more scarce than BTC .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 I really disagree that most other currencies are just speculative at this stage , Ethereum has a huge ecosystem already that 's generating real revenue for a lot of people , and many of the other coins you hear about represent apps on Ethereum or are more like company shares with an actual purpose .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`In regards to ETH being burned as part of the fee in relation to transactions , I do n't know if the ETH technically gets sent somewhere of if it simply gets deleted .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`You do n't have to buy 1 BTC at the time , you can buy as little as 0.00000001 BTC or 0.0000000000000001 ETH .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`If they choose not to mine the correct chain their ETH will be worthless , so they 'll just keep mining the chain that 's supported by the developers and the community .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 After reading that I would watch this to understand Ethereum : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjwr-7PgpN8`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; there are much better blockchains than Ethereum 

 There really is n't .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`ETH will have a lower level of inflation than BTC in about 1 year , but potentially as soon as 3 - 4 months from now .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Eventually the ETH 1 chain will migrate to ETH 2 , but for now ETH 2 is only running the Proof of Stake component .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`That is before factoring in the burn of ETH from transaction fees , which would bring the actual inflation closer to 0 % .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`It sounds like you have some fundamental misconceptions about how ETH works and how far it has progressed .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`The title of this post is literally " BTC and ETH pretty much unusable * right now * " so I think it 's fair to use examples of transactions that happened right now .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`What 's he 's cheekily alluding to , is that chains like Solana who are highly scalable , but not as secure or decentralized , should instead become a rollup on top of Ethereum .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Let Ethereum provide security and decentralization , so they do n't have to compete for network effect and security but can focus on delivering high throughput .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`There 's no denying Bitcoin leads on hash rate and market cap , but on pretty much any other meaningful metric Ethereum is leading , and I would say it 's so much its own thing that you ca n't reasonably call it an alt .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin has about 300,000 daily transactions , Ethereum has around 1,400,000 before factoring in layer 2 transactions .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`I know it 's basically impossible to " convince " anyone about why a project is good if they 've already made their mind up about it , but as someone who 's been into crypto for a very long time , imo Ethereum is hands down the best thing in crypto right now .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you 're willing to have your perception challenged , I would suggest you watch the video in this article to get a glimpse into what Ethereum is being used for by enterprise and why people believe it 's the most promising crypto : https://www.coindesk.com/time-is-running-out-to-win-the-blockchain-race`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`You have fundamentally misunderstood what Ethereum and DeFi is .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is permissionless , it 's whatever you want to make it .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 wETH is simply ETH that 's been converted to an ERC20 token which makes ETH easier to use in smart contracts .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;To be an Eth2 validator you need 32 eth , let 's not sugar coat that .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 This point really highlights where I think you fail to recognize what the key difference is between Solana and Ethereum and why Solana has high throughout .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`It seems like you 're on some crusade trying to prove that somehow Solana is " much better " than Ethereum , while it does n't even try to satisfy the core tenets in crypto of being decentralized or trustless .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't mean to sound rude , but it 's clear you 're not really an expert of either Solana or Ethereum , so while it 's fine to ask questions , I really do n't think you should be arguing with some of the people you 're arguing with in this thread .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`People say this a lot , but is there any basis for saying that about ETH or to think that 's bad for the network ?`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`If the price of ETH rises a lot as a result , the amount of ETH being burned will presumably drop unless people are still paying 100gwei for transactions with ETH at $ 30,000 which does n't seem likely , and it 's just going to make it so much more appealing for people to cash in .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 What I think is more unclear is what happens when there are n't any miners to dump a steady supply of ETH on the market .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`It does n't cost $ 30 to move ETH , 30 seconds ago this guy paid $ 3.50 : https://etherscan.io/tx/0x53f20177239cb546ca09c5ea794d1100106aec10fb5c0d735692c67c55ac6e70`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 I think your understanding of Ethereum seems incomplete and I would suggest you read up on the concepts behind the governing principles .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is an open source and permissionless project which means its fate is decided by a majority of people and projects supporting a particular chain .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Note that PoS is different from DPoS. There 's a lot of DPoS chains , but the first real PoS chain will be Ethereum in about 1 year .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 Right now Bitcoin and Ethereum are very expensive to attack , other chains are much less expensive to attack and the bridge connecting the chains will be even cheaper to attack .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`

 Personally I think it 's more likely you have Ethereum being the main chain with a ton of layer 2 solutions , and then maybe Cosmos standing on its own with a connection to Ethereum and some of the currency coins .`
epic_trader,favor,Ethereum,`Of all the crypto that 's around right now , BTC included , Ethereum is the safest bet for something that 's still around and in a leading position in 20 years if you ask me .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`fees are crazy on Metamask these days or well just the whole ECR20 ... just looked into adding few more on some of the coins I have on MM and ETH fee is in the 100 $ range so that turns a small cap coin 8 to something very expensive right now 🙈`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`yea that ’s the “ problem ” with low caps or new projects ; they wo n’t be in the major exchanges for a while which is why I use MM but desperately waiting for ETH 2.0 which hopefully fixes fees / speed of transactions to a more reasonable level .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`BTC : 1 m 
 ETH : 100k ( though devs were always late with their release I have faith by 2030 ETH 2.0 is live ) 
 ADA : 10 
 DOGE : & lt;0.1 ( unless the above predictions turn true and the meme lords pushed it hard just because they can ) 

 numbers based on today ’s USD ... because I ’m not 100 % sure that that will actually still exist in its current shape by 2030`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`I ’d keep some doge just for the good memories how you made your first crypto profits lol but other than that , going ETH / BTC is the best idea .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`DOGE might get some more hype and eventually that gets it to a 10 cents range so some 1.5 - 2x from where you are , both ETH as well as BTC are very likely going to outperform that in the years to come .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Personally I ’m s till hanging on to some doge ( and other coins ) but am 70 % in ETH / BTC`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`it seems literally impossible to lose money on any coin right now lol if it ’s somehow to do with crypto someone will buy it , if it mentions NFT in addition it will go like cold beer on a warm summer day ... time will fix that list of shit coins for sure and on the other hand it would n’t be the first meme to turn thin air into couple 1000 % profits ... sometimes throwing a dart is an as educated guess as reading reports for a day so to be honest , I ’d give your kids 100 $ worth of ETH and let them choose another 100 $ worth of what ever they want ( the unicorn for that matter is n’t even that bad of a choice lol ) and then check back few years later , explain the , what happened and why based on the choice they have taken vs. their main stream share into ETH 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`personally I own 25 coins even though the largest share is btc / eth I find those other projects interesting enough to own a piece of the cake and maybe there ’s even some I just have because I can 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`have some of them in my “ just in case ” bag as well lol think big question to me really is how all the ETH 2.0 will work out .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Not just in terms of fueling ETH itself but also what that on the other hand would mean to related coins currently solving some of the ETH issues ... what if the issues are gone 🤔 could n’t really wrap my head around that yet but something I ’m planning to spend some time on soon`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`At the very moment and with ETH 2.0 just few months away ( hopefully ) I ’d go 70/30 on ETH / BTC and let that grow for a while , use the time to research alts you ’re interested in and you might have knowledge of the industry they are tapping in a. I. are you into online gaming ? if yes check out related projects .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`When you feel ready , take say 10 - 15 % of your portfolio ( which will have grown by then riding the ETH wave ) and go for a couple alt coins you believe in .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Just like everyone else here I do n’t   have a crystal ball but I ’d be surprised not to see ETH going to 5 - 10k by end of this year if 2.0 materializes so get some solid profits from it which will then give you the flexibility to explore some alts with the profits`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Personally at the moment I ’d out the 100 into ETH which to me has a lot higher chance to 10x this Bull run rather than just next , reason being it ’s 2.0 release mid year which should fix some of its major issues ( insane fees and rather poor transaction performance amongst others ) so with just a small amount I ’d start there , make it couple 100 £ in the current Bull run and then eventually put some of it into BTC at its next dip .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`As for avoiding ETH fees on MM there ’s not much you can do other than trying to pick a day / time with slightly less traffic hence slightly lower fees .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`The fees are not due to or from uniswap or alike platforms that ’s the ETH gas fees that apply to any ECR20 token so not much you can do about them other than factor them into your purchase .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`BTC is a good choice , I ’d probably consider ETH before DOGE or least go 80 % BTC / ETH as a starting point .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`
 On Binance you can buy BTC and ETH straight with your fiat money ( USD ) , some other coins are traded in pairs so in order to get doge you ’d have to first get e.eg .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Gas fees also depend on the blockchain so e.g , right now ETH has huge fees , some others trade for a fraction of a cent .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`People wo n’t usually hold USD due to it ’s stable to declining value over time and when you already have ETH or BTC the .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Now if your primarily looking at holding , there ’s not much of an issue with RH and that ’s as true for ETH as for BTC .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 later this year should help its adoption / growth so 2nd half of 2021 should be good for ETH and personally I do believe it can get back to its 1:10 value ratio vs. BTC in the 6 - 12 months after the new release ( if it fixes the issues it should )`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`From al , I ’ve seen around the planned upgrades so far I do not expect anything will change for your ETH holdings .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`one off bonus ? at the very moment and if you can spare that 1000 bucks if just put them in ETH in one go in April and leave the there for the long run . reason being I ’d expect to see ETH going up further trough out 2021 so if you want to invest 1000 $ on it anyways , investing that now rather then spreading it over the next 12 months will get you more ETH in total .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Cryptos usually trade in pairs and that ’s what you ’re comparing here or looking at it at least so it ’s showing you the performance of ZIL vs dollar ( USDT is a stable coin bound to the dollar price ) , vs ETH and vs BNB ( so guess you ’re using Binance :) ) as to how to read trading charts , just google exactly that ... the markets might behave different but the tools / charts used are the same for stocks as well as crypto`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`To start your research coinmarketcap is a good place as it will give you a list of all coins and it has links to the project websites , communities etc nicely lined up for each coin .... and well ... keep larger part of your portfolio in BTC or ETH .. they will be your friends to cover your gambling losses 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Not yet 100 % sure how or if their time plan is taking ETH 2.0 launch into account though which is scheduled around the same time and we know ETH changes used to be slightly delayed in the past .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Now for a start I ’d recommend you take the money that ’s left , put it in BTC / ETH and just leave it there .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`For uniswap or coin swap in general you need a wallet ( a. I. Metamask or what ever is available in Ireland ) , you need ETH ( to buy those coins ) so need an exchange where you can buy ETH with either bank transfer or card .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Or you wait putting them on your HW wallet till after the new ETH release which should help with fees ... guess mostly depends on how much money you ’re planning to throw at it , having small amounts on a proper exchange is n’t as big of an issue as some people say`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`
 Not into mining myself so not sure these days mining ETH still is profitable looking at energy costs vs. minted coins`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Transfer without fees does n’t exist unfortunately so all you can try is at least keep fees low however XRP right now not traded on Coinbase so either wait till it ’s listed again or then the only way is to pick an exchange that still has it and buy there ( binance , kucoin ) once you have them , transferring XRP is very close to free think my last 1000 $ transaction took 20 cents or so compared to 30 $ and up trying to do the same with ETH`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`
 - sign up for an exchange such as Coinbase or Binance , and complete authentication 
 - decide on what you can afford to spend ( and lose worst case ) on a weekly or monthly bases 
 - put that money into the exchange ( bank transfer or card ) 
 - personally and for some safety I ’d recommend you just go BTC and ETH ( for now ) 
 - avoid checking stats ever6 day or panic sell when you see dips ... crypto is volatile and not a get rich quick scheme 

 Let ’s say you out 100 $ in each month ( just for example ) and you ’ll do that over 5 years you ’ll have piled up 6 grand , using Binance earn you can get a 2.5 % APY on that and by that time indicators are all green for both coins being factors higher than today it just wo n’t go up in a straight line so do n’t panic when it dips because that ’s how most people in crypto lose money`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Yea I ’ll wait for off peak hours then 1 ETH should be enough to cover gas for 1 DOGE 🤓`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Issue is the ether gas fees are crazy high these days so if you ’re transferring coins trough the ether network , you ’ll end up with quite high fees no matter the exchange .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`My crystal ball is undergoing some maintenance work lol but to throw some numbers at it .... BTC might hit that level , ETH could go as high as 10k in that time frame so in theory , owning 1 BTC or 12 ETH could do the trick .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`
 Now one thing I would recommend and I think many others here did , put a decent part of your portfolio on the “ safer bets ” a. I. BTC and ETH .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Guess some people mix up crypto with religion or something .. mean it ’s not that ETH and BTC for example would be competing ... different blockchain , different purpose , why not just benefit from both is beyond me 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`low cap coins at their early stages usually would be uniswap long time before they hit any reputable exchange ... easiest ( my view ) is get metamask ( make sure you download Form their website and not some dubious links as there ’s been loads of rotten seeds out there ) , connect to any ETH wallet , swap ETH for what ever coin you want ... there ’s not much that ’s not on Uniswap including couple 1000 coins no one should buy lol`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`

 now I ’m a long time holder ( leaned to not panic with dips ) hence only really review my portfolio on a quarterly bases or so , checking if some of the low cap projects still look good or not and eventually adjust portfolio mix if needed to keep my 70/30 ( 70 % BTC / ETH , 30 % alts ) avoiding the hassle to chase the quick buck from trying to time peaks and dips right .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`look at what they do ( the industry / market they tap into ) and then add the generally growing trend of decentralization ( and digitalization ) and all of a sudden things people call shitcoins ( 90 % of the time everything that ’s not BTC or ETH is called that ) might look a bit less shit .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Guess he ’s referring to projects like Cardano or polkadot .. though I think it wo n’t be a winner takes it all scenario there ’s plenty of room for several projects in that space however for now ETH has by far most applications running in their network so u less they mess up the upgrades ( or significantly delay them ) they should do really well 2nd half of the year`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`my gut feeling says you ’ll loose more than if you just send them as they are even though some coins especially on the ether network do have quite crazy fees these days .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`well and in general nothing wrong being a bit BTC / ETH heavy in case you ca n’t decide which of the others to increase 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`♂ ️ less but well chosen coins to some extent increase growth if they succeed a. I. ETH is pretty likely to go 10x in the years to come , as it ’s quite likely that not all will perform as well in which case a higher share in ETH would have yielded bigger returns overall .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Almost 10x for the last 12 months so been riding this Bull for a while lol kinda wonder where ETH can go after the release / halving`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Just personal opinion .. but would agree with your order however also do n’t think any of them will significantly outperform ETH in the long run so might as well just go higher on your ETH stake .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Just do n’t see any of the 3 projects sky rocket and whilst they are solid I ’d rather expect them to just grow with the market than on their own hence ETH just feels like the safer bet for similar expected growth though if you ’re into the 3 projects and believe in them , you can still as well just cut back on their portfolio share , keep them at some 1 % and put the rest in BTC / ETH .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`But looking at what e.g. ETH has in the making for 2nd HY I ’d rather say end 21 than mid ... but that ’s an as good guess as yours`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`guess only you can answer that question for your specific situation but first might want to answer these two : 
 1 ) could you afford to loose you ’re ETH say if bear market hits before you cashed in on profits 
 2 ) if that would happen , can you still afford to pay the loan back 

 not saying it ca n’t work out and chances for ETH to tank completely is n’t that high BUT your basically doubling up on risk as not only your crypto investment could drop but at the same time you ’d still have to pay the loan back and if you get into delays   the interest rate wo n’t stay at just 10 % - end of the day there ’s no guarantee for success and there ’s no such as guaranteed 5x especially not if you need the money at certain fixed dates to pay for e.g a loan ... well that ’s my 2 satoshi`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Easiest to get those is uniswap ( e.g. use metamask wallet ) there you can swap ETH for pretty much 99 % of the coins in circulation .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`♂ ️ only way that makes sense if you are on a platform that has high APY for stacking stable coins ( a. I. CDC has some pretty high rates ) else just keep a decent part in BTC / ETH which still is volatile but on a long term growth trajectory .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`that ’s what I ’ve done a few days ago ... well still have an 0.1 BTC which I ’m not sure why that happens but rest is ETH now .. no more mainstream 😎`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Obviously that does n’t help new people getting into crypto but even then I personally believe that the further growth will keep easing the pain if you hold some ETH .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`turned my BTC into ETH which is now 75 % of my portfolio but have the other 25 % spread across close to 30 projects I believe in or can even use myself ( working products ) .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`None of them on its own is more than 1 % and I ’m not following all that closely but I do interact with some daily ( technology / product wise ) 

 some might outperform BTC / ETH , some might not but bottom line for me it ’s lot more interesting than just stare at charts and $ conversion rates .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Sorry was my fault I ’ve moved my BTC to ETH 😔 promise wo n’t do it again for the next weeks`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`I had the same and went even more extreme few months back , grabbed some nice gains from btc going 11 to 60k at that time but believe ETH will see bigger growth in the years to come ...`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`  none of us “ knows ” but btc will “ just ” keep being a store of value , ETH is the chain with by far most active applications running on it ( 4500 + vs. sub 500 for btc ) and a pretty bright roadmap ahead of it ... just my 2 gwei 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`already dropped a lot ... personally I ’d probably consider buying at 100 - 120 but then again Coinbase vs. ETH 🤔 not sure I can taklk myself out of the   ore obvious choice lol`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`most of my alts are here to feed my ETH bag which I feel will dip less hard than smaller projects even if the bear market hits and having some cash at the side to DCA into coins when the dips happen is always good for the long run .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Well one major difference is the gas fees in crypto so that ’s not the “ broker ” charging it and particularly for ETH these days the gas fees are pretty crazy .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`so to your question I guess if you want to decide like “ today ” then maybe TRX would your option to go , if waiting a year does n’t make a difference then chances are we will see lower ETH fees by then .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`♂ ️ 

 The more serious investments there after got me more into some of the “ boring ” stuff like BTC / ETH , ADA , LINK , ... 

 these days I just have a 10 % bag of my portfolio which is gambling money spread across a rather large spread of low cap projects I personally like and which might or might not face massive growth as they tap into major markets but still might fail to beat competition hence just die as fast as they popped up`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`

 seen you got some of your crypto addresses included in the file so I ’ll drop you some ETH ! built tons of excel sheets for all sorts of stuff so this one has been some crazy amount of work`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`ETH gas fees are at an ATH these days .. few options to check out ( not using trust wallet myself ) 

 - if you can , check what it would cost to convert your USDC to XRP and check XRP transfer fees , they should be in the cents if TW is n’t charging separately 
 - if the above does n’t work / costs too much as well , check fees on Sunday somewhere during US night time , usually that can get some lower 
 - wait for ETH 2.0 to fix the fees issue ( now that ’s not 2021 ... ) 
 - look at it as savings account , see if you can stack the 200 $ ( or exchange cheap for a coin on TW ) and just have it sit there till fees improve and still earn some interest 

 would say in that order .... if you can exchange it for XRP cheap , XRP has very low transfer fees so that could work out but check before doing as I really do n’t know what additional fees TW might apply`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`well then I ’d say check Sunday night maybe or else maybe you can stack USDC on TW and just have it sit there and gain some interest at least till ETH fees improve`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`weird .. mean we have seen high ETH fees these days but fk 800 $ 🤔 that ’s really odd mean let ’s say you hit a really busy day and ETH gas fees were some 100 $ that would still mean they charged you 700 $ to convert and transfer 1 ETH ? have n’t used any of the two but that feels more like scam than fees if it ’s true`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Sorry was me I ’ve sold my BTC and ETH to buy that coin everyone was talking about 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`think the best way really would be to give a few examples ( recent rug pulls where people lost it all , last BTC crash where 20k turned 3k in days , ... ) but other than that , maybe on some they do have a point .. mean he ’s 80 so he ’s not investing with a 30 years horizon so it ’s also about finding the balance of having some more secure foundation ( BTC , ETH , show the evolution of them that might be convincing ) and then why not have 20 % or something into hype stuff 

 without any judging spending 1000 $ on doge few months ago would be 100’000 today 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`Honestly with all ETH has in the tank right now I ’d be surprised not to see it ’s price going back to the 1:10 ratio vs. Bitcoin which we ’ve seen several times in the past .`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`I ’ve decided to drop my main BTC bag into ETH instead end of 2020 - must say I have n’t regretted it a single day since 🤷`
larrythecableguy76,favor,Ethereum,`No one can really predict the future but I ’d be surprised not seeing ETH climbing back up to 1:10 to BTC price wise .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`I hate price speculating ... 

 But $ 801 ETH is a huge ' psychological ' line for many , should we cross it .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 Ultimately the market is realizing * * BTC / ETH are forever * * , so this wo n't happen like it did few years ago .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 ETH doing what I knew it would ! new ATH incoming !`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`I 'm more excited for what happens after ETH hits $ 1,000 .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`BTC will make you rich .. 

 ETH will make your grandkids rich .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`ETH , let me sleep .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 I knew ETH would hit 1k , but overall , this run is surpassing most expectations .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 Next time BTC starts moving , expect ETH to trampoline .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`The community has already done the due diligence for ETH , so you do n't have to .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`365 days from now , ETH at $ 2k would be a steal .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`ETH gaining ratio to BTC is making me so bullish .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 Next time BTC moves up 5 - 10 % , ETH is OUT of here .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`June 1st , 2021 , 

 BTC will be \_\_\_\_\ _ , 

 ETH will be \_\_\_\_\_\_\ _ ,`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Depends on who you ask , but buying 165 ETH at its 2 - year peak says something .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 Second , this is what ETH 2.0 will fix , as well as some less annual supply .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`If you 're expecting ETH to hit $ 10,000 , then buy now and hodl , doubt you will worry about any gas fee after making 10x .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`2 years from now :  


 " I really wish I had n't chickened out on buying 5k of eth when it was sub $ 1000 acouple years ago .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Can we talk about whoever just bought $ 1.2 Million of ETH .... 

 [ https://imgur.com/a/Qo9ikXg](https://imgur.com/a/Qo9ikXg )`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Honestly I do n't know , but I do know selling ETH is the dumbest thing you can do right now .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 A project like ETH ca n't have a supply cap , because eth is used so much in every single transaction , smart contract or erc-20 token that gets moved .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`No not really , ETH is nearly even with its previous ATH marketcap , while BTC is 250 % higher that its previous ATH market cap .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 So ETH still has a way to go to catch up :) 

 Very bullish , does n't really change much .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 You can see how many [ coins run on Ethereum 's blockchain.](https://etherscan.io / tokens ) 

 And not to mention the backbone of the DeFi movement .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Ethereum literally turned money into an API . 

 No , I have n't give up on money , I 'm investing in a better use - case for it .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 BTC goes sideways , alts go up , then ETH goes BOOM .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 Comment if you think ETH will flip BTC in 10 years .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Why is ETH literally repeating last weekend ... started a slow rise like this , then 40 % rise lol .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 , when complete , will cut annual supply issuance by 50 % + 

 Take that how you may .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`I do n't think anything is going to outperform ETH in the near term and long term .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`o.o 

 lol my technical analysis says an upside down circle is forming to take ETH to the moon .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 We 'll soon see ETH become completely be in a league of its own .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`If you have BTC or ETH and you panic sell at a loss , you 're better off putting your money in a .011 % interest account at a bank or something .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`ETH flipping BTC is what I 'm here for`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`got my buy orders locked for ETH , just a liiitlle further down .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`If ETH 2.0 got you excited , start reading up on DeFi .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Is n't it funny how someone can sue a " crypto " project ? 

 And its token is affected HEAVILY by this ? 

 Try suing BTC , or ETH , or Monero , or Chainlink , or UNISWAP , the list goes on ... 

 Blockchain literally was created with the goal being decentralization .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`I think many would argue that BTC and ETH do n't have " Plenty downsides " .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 I agree with you , and that 's why I only focus on BTC and ETH . 

 And a select 2 - 3 others that I know are decentralized and truly have great DeFi products that are being used in the masses .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`I do n't think Ethereum gets looked over at all .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 I do own ETH ( of course ) , and I highly recommend you read up on DeFi if you 're thinking about investing as well .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 You ca n't just do basic math on circulating supply and price with ETH .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`With your take that ETH is ' cult ' like because the inventor is still active in its development , let 's think about BTC .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`The eth community obviously will have an open ear to vitalik 's opinions , he created the damn thing .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`But you 're mistaken if you think he has direct control of the Ethereum project .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`( In the form of a synthetic asset that is ) 

 Ethereum is innovating , BTC is just BTC .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 BTC can compete with gold all it wants , Ethereum is competing with central banking and the finance industry .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 To say that vitalik is the chairman and eth is a central bank is just borderline troll - like .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 I 'm guessing you 're an ETH miner or something who is salty that they are moving to proof of stake .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 It 's apparent BTC & amp ; ETH are here to stay , panic is for the foolish this time around .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`ETH had a +40 % day like 1.5 weeks ago was it ? 

 My prediction is another parabolic day to break ATH by a good amount this weekend .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`So ? 

 Maker has 20x less volume than ETH , and let 's not even compare market caps .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 And now you 're comparing BTC to ETH , your original comparison was ETH to new ETH projects .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 P.S. still bullish that ETH will hit ATH within 8 hours .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`ETH & lt ; $ 400 for a year --&gt ; \*\*crickets 

 ETH gains 1000 % ---&gt ; \*\*OP buys 

 ETH gains 15 % --&gt ; \*\*OP : " why is this so damn stable "`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 Maybe I 'll sell my ETH bag and I wo n't need imagination I 'll be it .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`ETH is up +11 % today , and you are on here talking about a ' correction ' 

 Got ta love it .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`
 Long term is what matters and BTC and ETH have taught us that already .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Notice how BTC was wrapped and moved over to Ethereum 's blockchain .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Just when I thought I 'd never get another discount on ETH :) 

 Happy Thursday all !`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`If you are n't DCA buying BTC and ETH right now , idk what to tell you`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 But also , let 's be real , the Ethereum blockchain and the disruptive apps it enables to be built ontop of it , is something we 've never really seen .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Tell me out of the * * top 63 * * DeFi projects you see , how many are on your ' Ethereum killer ' chain ?`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Umm , you guys see the ETH / BTC ratio climbing too ?`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`o.o 

 I like where this is going ETH ...`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`20 days ago , BTC cracked $ 32k ( what its at right now ) 

 20 days ago , ETH was trading in the $ 700s .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`I mean 4 ETH is not life changing money , best thing to do is to hold unless you need this money ( in that case , probably should n't be investing ) 

 Ethereum is amongst the safest bets in the long term .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`Every project can say what you just did : 

 \- " Stellar is * * working on * * a turing smart contract " 

 \- " * * Coming up * * is Wirex savings which lets you .... " 

 And the USDX stable coin you speak of , $ 26 million market cap ... 

 Saying " but Stellar is faster " does n't have much merit because it ca n't do what Ethereum can with its powerful smart contracts .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 That 's like saying " company X has better customer service than Amazon because company X has 1000x less users " 

 You 're essentially comparing XLM to ETH , claiming its faster , has more potential .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`I 'm not saying XLM is a shitcoin , but if compared to ETH 's ecosystem , its an ant .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 Dai is a product of Maker , which also , is built on ETH . 

 Saying " ETH holders waiting for layer 2 💀 " 

 Is like Android saying " We had face ID before Apple " 

 Difference is , Apple has an eco - system while Android has phones .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`

 I think ETH will go crazy in February .`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`The 2021 all time highs for BTC & amp ; ETH will be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\ _`
LilKrypto,against,Ethereum,`They have already launched , and ETH is doing better actually lol : 

 [ https://twitter.com/CMEGroup/status/1358430318861180930](https://twitter.com/CMEGroup/status/1358430318861180930 ) 

 Just shows how people look for a reason to panic .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`we had a freaking crazy btc / eth AKA everything pump without any correction , its to be expected`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I believe eth will have its own time`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`You are delusionnal if you think ETH will reach 15k in 2021`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I do nt see anything over 5k$ , if eth 2.0 was released the sky would be the limit .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`But like someone else said , due to gas fees , eth is extremely limited in its growth , 2.0 is needed NOW , like even yesterday`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I do nt see eth going really high without 2.0 released .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`
 Like prove me wrong i would be happy af as i own eth too , but that s just wishful thinking in my book to expect a 10x in a year`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`No doubt that Ethereum will be bigger than BTC 20 - 30 years down the road`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Absolutely , imo your main asset should either be BTC or ETH .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I would nt ever have over 25 % in alt coins ( i do nt consider ETH to be an altcoin ) .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`

 I think ETH will also be there and massive 20 years down the road .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Now , i hold more ETH than BTC because i think it has more upside growth possible .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`20k ETH is straight up delusionnal , how can an asset that returns 300 % in a quarter be your least performing one ? like how ?`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`ETH ai nt a stable coin anymore lets all jump in !`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`my ass 

 Teach them about defi , about what ETH can do ...`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`It runs on ethereum , how can you even expect it to cross eth`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Yea why not , but its risky ... 

 Your best bet is always to buy and hold BTC and ETH ( you could DCA yourself to a nice position ) .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I only buy from Shakepay , they sell ETH / BTC .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Some people said : hey we do nt like where bitcoin / eth is going , we think it should do this or that instead .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I m confident this wo nt suck out even 0.1 % of ETH transactions .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Also , do nt send such small amount of bitcoin OR eth , fees will destroy you .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Eth current network as scalability issues , it can be fixed NOW by using layer 2 solutions , or will be fixed by eth 2.0`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`

 And yes I also think ETH will be bigger / more useful than BTC in the future .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I do nt think so , if you manage to get your hands on 30 series cards , mining can be almost a better move than buying eth .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`If eth crashes , you still have very valuable cards to sell on the market , your investment is safe , whereas if you buy eth ( which is right now over it ath in uncharted theory ) you can lose a lot if it ends up dumping .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`But yes everybody knows ethereum is having issues , just pray that 2.0 drops quickly or that uniswap moves to layer 2 so it stops taking a quarter of all the eth fees`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`He just hates the man for trying to turn eth into a for profit organisation and he firmly believes ada is a centralized shitcoin .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`" Ethereums has a scaling problem because its Blockchain is massive ( Even after pruning its around 600 GB . ) " 

 Lol what ? 

 Ethereum scaling issue comes from the fact that its getting used more and more while the network ca nt grow at the same pace or quicker pace .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`  Well no because bigger blocks means more time to fill them up which means empty blocks popping every now and then on the blockchain , which means wasted gas space ... 

 Ethereum scaling is a shitshow of a problem , its not really this or that the only cause , but saying that its blockchain will get too big if you try to scale it up is only touching the tippy top of the iceberg`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Its so far behind the curve that i hardly see it gaining enough momentum to flip ETH before 2.0 gets released , it being 1 year or 2 years down the road ... 

 I agree there will be enough place for multiple projects .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I simply think people are getting way too hyperz right now , there is nothing justifying its 1/4 of eth 's market cap while its basically not even a working product yet`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`The original post said that cardano is destined to be # 1 , meaning flipping ETH .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm saying that i do n't think Cardano will overtake ETH in the next two years , and * * if they do n't * * , i also think it will * * NEVER *`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`If Cardano does nt come in clutch right now before 2.0 is out , there will be no such things as " ETH killers " 

 Time will tell , thanks for not being a jackass and having a decent chat`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`No , it 's to pick a time to interact with the ethereum network such as maybe withdrawing your ETH to your wallet .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Its a centralized copy cat of ethereum with so many exploits because all the projects on there are by people copy pasting eth contracts without actually understanding the tech behind it`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I know fees are a problem , but it 's common knowledge that you should n't transfer small amount of ETH .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,` 

 People saying do n't use ethereum or whatever because of these reason should simply do their research , this can be avoided with basic understanding on how ETH actually works`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I never said ETH is a store of value either .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Y'all keep screaming " but muh fees so high you ca n't do anything " , and then i see you guys are trying to transfer 5 $ worth of eth and do nt actually undestand how to deal with gwei prices / gas limits ... 

 There are Layer 2 solutions that basically eliminates gas fees , but seems like nobody here cares about that .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Saying everything operates poorly does nt say anything , actually you can argue that Ethereum works flawlessly .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Funny how people cry about ETH 's fees while BTC is literaly 4 to 5 times pricier to use ... put EThereum network activity on ANY decentralised chain and the fees would be the same .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I do nt see ETH success being a drawback .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`All it can bring on the table are ETH dapps clones with exploits ... 

 BSC will always exists , but it will never be aa important as what ETH is trying to accomplish .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Add that ethereum will one day be almost infinitely scalable and will also be ( very soon ) deflationnary , you could argue the case that Ethereum can even beat   Bitcoin at its own " store of value " game .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I think you should also understand that fees   on ADA would be the same if it had Ethereum 's network activity , i think you underestimate how popular it really is .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`

 People are in ETH for the hard and long road , Ethereum is the pioneers blockchain , devs are theory crafting things that were previously thought impossible .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`

 My problem is that recently i 've seen newbies spamming that fees on ETH are unsustainable and they keep claiming that devs will never push out 2.0 .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Personnaly i do nt touch anything BSC related , its all copy pasted stuff from ETH by more or less competent devs ... i would nt say its safe , but i would nt say its throwing your money out of the window either`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum is taking the hard way by building new technologies and building a chain that will be scalable while remaining decentralized .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Those fees are the only thing holding ETH from being the number 1 crypto`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Only 2 eth are created per block my guy , does n't matter if blocks are giving out 6 ETH to miners right now , 4 ETH of that amount are from fees ( already in circulation ether ) .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum is a candle while DOGE is a match , the hype just wo n't last since doge has no fundamentals .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`In your way of saying it , you will have missed ETH 's rocket to the moon 10 years down the road .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm not eating down my nails right now for holding ETH .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`And the fact remains that , longterm , large caps or simply BTC / ETH will bring in the most gains if you only think about the money part .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`

 But i 'm confident that longterm , like 10 years down the road , the difference between the gains you made with altcoins this year compared to if you used that money to lets say buy ETH only would be much smaller than it is right now ( even with ETH probably coming on top ) .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Fees will be burned , if more than 2eth of fees are burned per blocks , that means that eth will be deflationnary , as only 2 eth are issued ( printed ) per blocks .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Canada already has one , not even talking about the multiple ETH etf 's too ...`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Now that it pumps by itself everybody is an ETH believer lol ... used to be down voted to hell a couple months ago when i was saying that in the future Ethereum will inevitably surpass BTC`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Wo n't change a thing , the limiter is for ETH hash only , and you wo n't be able to still mine ethereum for long anyway .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`you sell them back for what you paid , pocketing all that eth you mined .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Just the fact that you need a 5000 $ pc to run a validator node tells me nahh they wo nt be much of a contender to eth`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Selling any Ethereum before eip-1559 is foolish imo as we are so close to it ... ( ill extend that to selling before 2.0 )`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Uniswap i only use when eth gas fees are low , can cost a bit for swaps`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Reality is , most ICO 's are just ways for " developpers " to receive ( or steal ) free BTC / ETH from noob investors who do nt understand the gimmick that ICO 's are ...`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`

 You need to understand how gas works so you do n't do a rookie mistake such as changing those already in place numbers in the hopes of saving eth by using a lower gas limit or whatnot ... thus in the end costing you more than it should .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Holding eth is just that , holding it without doing anything with it .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`ETH was 90$USD in march 2020 , now it sits at 35x that ...`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Sure miners will keep claiming eth 1.0 is the real chain and that everyone should use that instead , but people just wo nt care about it man , just like people in general do nt care about BCH .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`I m starting to cash out my alts , holding ETH for ever though , just that shit going to 100k`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum already 35x ... do nt get your hopes too high , we are way closer to the end of the bull run than the beginning of it .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`

 Everyone has their strategies , imo Ethereum will reach 100k in the future , why would i risk it all by trying to time the market to MAYBE make a little more ? that s dumb .`
99Thebigdady,neither,Ethereum,`ETH actually has developpers and users lol and it actually has a clear idea of what it will be in the future , eth 2.0 .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Ok so this morning i got some eth at 1830 $ , I tought it was good price , until it was not`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I am not sure if I should take a 100 $ loss on ETH and let it go , expectations are not great`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Story is not over : I bought ETH .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Never used ETH , let 's say I wanna sell 1k moons how much in fees I would have to pay ?`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`2500 $ ETH is good but I wonder how 2600 $ feels like ( not for everyone )`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`2 months ago I was such a noob and bought like 300 $ of ETH for 1800 $ , then I sold it to 1500 $ , now I laugh to myself , learned from mistake for sure`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`DOGE volume higher then ETH last 24h , I do n't even know what is real anymore .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n't believe people buying ETC thinking is a cheap ETH ...`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I mean they see ETC at 35 $ and think , oh well this is going to flip ETH at 2500 $ let 's buy it LMAO`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Every upvote that I get I buy 10 $ worth of ETH .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Stop talking about " 2018 all over again , same feelings " , I heard that even with febraury correction with bitcoin at 42k and ETH at 1300 , look at the prices now .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH going to 2k I am all in , selling my car and get a bus season ticket`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH to 8 K , we all know it 's going to happen , it will feel pretty good`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I am super tempted of dumping all my CAKES in 70 % profit and go hard on ETH`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ok just bought 0.7 ETH more , let 's go baby`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`imagine when ETH 2.0 is ready`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Oh my god I did n't check charts for like couple of hours ETH is mooning 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`what do you mean ETH ca n't move ? was 2230 like 10h ago , it went up to 2475`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I love this ETH run , just hope BTC wo n't ruin the party but ...`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Ca n't believe ETH was 86 $ a year ago ..`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH flying : New people see " Ethereum classic " at   33 $ thinking is going to flip ETH 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I am curious to see if a BTC dump now , could affect still ETH a lot or no .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`that reminds us BTC is still the king , ETH ca n't party without him`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I know that 's most likely because of ETH gas fee tho .. but yeah`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH really trying to drag BTC up today , I love to see that`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I still have the same amount of ETH as 2 hours ago tbf`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`today I got a second job 3 times week for the evening , all the cash will flow straight into ETH`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`BTC goes up 0.01 % ETH : Let me moon`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`morning from EU , I see ETH at 2560 $ , that 's a good day`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Meanwhile watching ETH chart 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH so close to another ATH ... let 's goooo`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I wonder how a 2700 $ ETH feel like`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`2700 $ ETH feels good but I wonder how a 2800 $ ETH feel like`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`0.05 BTC / ETH is happening today , nothing can stop this`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`MOONS and ETH mooning what a time to be alive`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is like what dip ?`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n't sleep with ETH doing that stuff honestly`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`BTC does a little green candle ,    ETH : I am going to mars now`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH pushing for 2800 $ and no one talking about this here , I am disappointed`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I am a simple guy , I DCA into VET and ETH every week`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ooof just woke up to ETH 2870 $ , that 's a good morning`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`jesus ETH is on fire , I have no words anymore`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`another day , anoter ETH ATH , I think we are at 6 days streak or something 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`oh man I am busy today and everytime I check charts ETH is in ATH , lol`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETC up 25 % only because ETH pumping makes me feel lose hope in the humanity honestly lol`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I am a simple guy , I have some fiat : I buy VET and ETH , that 's it`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`the more I read about ETH and the more impressed I am , is going to change the world for sure`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`my body is ready for an ETH 3 K , let 's do it`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I got ta go to sleep but I ca n't miss ETH hitting 3 K absolutely`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`no matter if is sunday , ETH still hit another ATH today , like 8 days straight now .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I wonder if ETH goes straight for 3100 $ very fast , or pullback from 3K. But ai n't matter because I 'm not selling until I can buy my house`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`In 10 years I can tell my son , " I was there , in the cryptocurrency subreddit when ETH hitted 3 K son "`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`nothing gets this sub more excited then ETH pumping btw lol except VET pumping`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I open charts first time in 5 hours and let 's see how ETH is doi .......... 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`MOONS at 0.135 $ and ETH 3170 $ , what a monday`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I had a dream yesterday , ETH touched 3200$. Oh wait ....`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Wait , I wish I had 1 ETH .`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's gooooooo ETH 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Damn I realized I did n't drink enough water today , was too busy on watching ETH chart`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Guys yesterday I dreamed that ETH was almost at 3.5$K , crazy ...`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`here is how does it feel to be balls deep on LINK and ETH today 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`It seems like yesterday that we were celebrating the 2.7 K ETH lol`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I had a nightmare yesterday , people selling good coins like ETH for buying a meme dog coin , thank god it was just a nightmare 🤡`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`For once I do n't feel the dip a lot because I am 90 % ETH - LINK , man that feels good`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 3700 $ EOD let 's gooo 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 3K€ sooooo close let 's go 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH price in 8 years from now ?`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Do I pay only 0.003 ETH for withdrawing from binance to Ledger X ? seems reasonable`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's see if we get some match , mine is Breaking Bad and ETH`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH : Oh shit I forgot , I have to do the daily ATH let me go 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`ETH wants this dominance to go up 

 ! [ gif](giphy|wazvvYSGdvJhm )`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`some people saying is too late to get rich with Bitcoin ... they do n't know about ETH . 

 !`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I need more FIAT for buying ETH`
valciro123,favor,Ethereum,`I am from the future and in the 2029 bull run people are buying the ETH dip , the dip is 38K$`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Two possible interpretations : 

 \-People want to donate their worthless bags of random shitcoins to devs as a " thank you " for finally making ETH 2.0 a reality .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`They may have thought " uh , Bitcoin is already so expensive right now , but ETH is still cheap and looks promising " .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Indeed plenty of these new , unexperienced retail investors who entered the market at that time because they heard there 's profits to be made did invest in ICOs ( and thus bought ETH ) because they saw more potential growth in those fancy new token unlike Bitcoin which already was " so expensive " .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`What gives Bitcoin ( or Ethereum ) value is that they are out of reach of any single entity ( government , company , law enforcement ... ) .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`I do n't see where this was hyped up or the ETH community as a whole has been disingenuous .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Only downside is that they offer a small collection of coins but I am mostly interested in BTC and ETH anyway .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`We 've been in a bullmarket for some time now and when you compare altcoin charts it seems pretty clear that some of them still have life in them ( ETH obviously and some others ) and other alts are just flatlining because the speculators have lost all interest in them .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Look at what that new money from institutional investors is buying : BTC and a little ETH .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Well , now that you have befriended Vitalik , maybe you can convince him that ETH is a " premined scam " and that he should sell it all for BTC .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Be aware that ETH 2.0 is released in different phases .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`

 Regardless of that , ETH is a very solid project and it 's expected to do well in this bullmarket , regardless of what happens when phase 0 activates .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`However any sidechain like xDai is never gon na be as secure as the ETH mainnet , therefore I only put moderate amounts in there and then convert back to DAI , ETH or whatever .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Ethereum has no hardcap , it 's governance is completely different and it 's protocol is a constant work in progress and will always be .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`If many future apps will be built on that platform it will make ETH very valuable , but the value proposition is just a very different one from Bitcoin .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`There was a guy here a few weeks ago who lost 100k worth of ETH because of that .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`HEX is just a token on Ethereum , it does n't solve any problem , it does n't have any utility , the only promise it has is " number go up " if you buy and lock up HEX .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`They either buy BTC ( maybe ETH ) as longterm hold or if they feel lucky they buy some of the new coins like DOT that look promising right now .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Most alts fail , while with BTC ( and ETH ) we can be pretty sure they will still be around and doing well in 5 years time .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`You get what I am saying ... 

 I think due to my age I am more patient , less emotional and less risk - friendly with my choice of coins ( I hold BTC and ETH .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`He says BTC and ETH are entirely different in their structure and value proposition but the market has high demand for both of them .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`His thesis is basically that ETH will go through exactly the same cycles as Bitcoin did , but ETH is younger and one cycle behind .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Did you see Raoul Pal 's argument why ETH might go this high during this cycle ?`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`We are clearly in a bullmarket right now and you insist that the ETH price will be stuck at this level for 12 more months just because you see a few sell walls right now ?`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`The bear market made me conservative and stick to BTC and ETH .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Some of them are just starting to warm up to the idea of getting a bit of ETH .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Imagine holding Tron until today , still hoping it 's gon na kill ETH , lol .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Some friends think I am irresponsible but I do n't daytrade and I hold mostly BTC / ETH .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Nano is supported by Ledger , however it 's not integrated directly into Ledger Live ( unlike BTC and ETH ) .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`His main thesis is that ETH is basically following in Bitcoin 's footsteps in terms of price discovery - but it 's one cycle behind Bitcoin ( because it 's much younger ) .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`The days were BTC went 50x or 20x from one ATH to the next are numbered but ETH because it 's younger but equally relevant than BTC , has still more room to grow )`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm increasingly confident that we will see 10k ETH in this cycle .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`( Fun fact : there was a guy here a while ago who picked the first 24 words from the list that start with the letter A and indeed he found that that wallet had been used previously and there was still time tiny fraction of ETH or so on there ) .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`The ETH charts shows that it has been growing faster than Bitcoin \*consistently\`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`So it does n't sound too crazy to expect ETH to reach 7x its previous ATH , which would place it at 10k`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`

 Another aspect is that the prices of most coins including Ethereum are not derived from their actual usage but from speculation about the future value of the project .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`As long as investors believe that ETH has a bright future and can solve its problems , it wo n't matter to the price action that many of its applications are barely usable temporarily due to gas fees .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`But as soon as it is shown that PoS can be equally secure ( if ETH and ADA manage to get it right ) , then there 's little excuse anymore and yes , Bitcoin will be criticized for it even more than now .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`BTC ( and ETH ) are for long term holding , alts are for short term gains .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`You do n't want to sell your precious Bitcoin , so you can wrap it by putting it in a corresponding smart contract where it will be locked up and you get a token for your wrapped Bitcoin with which you can transact on the Ethereum blockchain , do token swaps and whatever .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`The market seems to have decided that it only cares about the original Bitcoin and Ethereum and not any of their forks .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Unless you already have a truly deep understanding of all the tech ( I do n't ) , it will be hard for you to judge which of the two models is better and if you go to the subs of ETH and DOT , they may have the technical knowledge but their opinions are of course heavily biased towards their own platform .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`I am usually slightly skeptic but with everything happening right now I truly believe that 10k ETH by the end of this year is well possible .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`That 's a looot of LTC , you must really be a strong believer if you think it will make more gains than BTC or ETH throughout this bullmarket .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Now , because we are degenerate crypto gamblers , someone figured out how to to extract the moons from the Reddit vault to send them to other addresses on the Ethereum testchain on which they run , from there they can be send to the xDai network and there they can be traded .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`You will need some Rinkeby ETH to send them out from there to xDai or whereever though .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`He too realized that fees are killing ETH applications right now and ETH 2.0 might be too long away .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Same with ETH , investors ignore temporary issues if they believe those will be solved .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`You are so new to this market , why not just stick to the coins that \*everyone\ * agrees will succeed : Bitcoin and Ethereum .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`But if you compare the electricity consumption of the two , ETH is only a small fraction of what BTC requires .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are the most solid investments , I would n't go into alts if you are new , they are more risky and less predictable .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`In the ETH sub last week they posted that " Y'all got any more of them sub $ XXX ETH ? " meme three times in a single day .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm literally crying about my lost gains on ICX , it 's the Korean Ethereum after all , half of Asia will run on it in the near future .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Proof of Work is the consensus mechanism that Bitcoin and Ethereum use , it 's the most tested and secure way to secure a blockchain .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`So , the Ethereum community has decided that the old Proof of Work mechanism is too electricity intensive and backward and that they want to adopt a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake which does n't use more electricity than any other server on the internet .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`The advantage for users is that they can stake their ETH , which helps to keep the network secure and makes them money without using any extra energy .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 will be rolled out in different phases , the first one already started , the last one may still be 2 years away .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`For someone that 's new here it 's always a good idea to stick to the big coins BTC and ETH first , otherwise you may easily end up just gambling your money away ...`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Sure , some alt coins pump harder right now than btc and eth , but for how long ?`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`ETH had been outperforming BTC for the past year or so , is there anything that makes you suspect that this will change ?`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`In my opinion ETH is still a more solid and less risky investment than putting that money into any particular altcoin , especially the newcomers .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Same with ETH , yes the high fees make many applications barely usable right now , but most investors understand this is a temporary problem that 's being worked on and with zkRollups and other L2 solutions , this might change in the next few months , even before sharding on ETH 2.0 will be live .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`But as it turned out most of that was just hype and they did not outperform or kill ETH because fees and tps is only one small aspect of valuating a project .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`They are currently bidding 247 ETH ( $ 480k ) on an NFT for a remastered version of the iconic Nyan Cat gif from 10 years ago .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Vitalik is just a little shy , do n't pressure him , otherwise ETH will never cross that 2k mark .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Saying that I do expect ETH to eventually gain better in BTC value .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`

 [ https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-developers-eye-july-gas-saving-eip-1559-launch](https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-developers-eye-july-gas-saving-eip-1559-launch/ ) 

 It changes how gas fees are calculated and introduces fee burning , which will lower the annual issuance of ETH to a level similar to Bitcoin .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`One of the common arguments against ETH is that it does n't have a hard cap like Bitcoin and therefore can inflate forever .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`It 's really nice to see all these updates for Ethereum coming along .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`There 's also EIP 1559 which will be implemented in July and introduce fee burning and lower the issuance of ETH , making it more scarce ( it 's not a hard cap like Bitcoin but has a similar effect ) .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`ETH has the largest dev network and they wo n't just abandon the entire platform due to temporarily high fees .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`We had this before : When EOS and Tron came out , they claimed ETH devs will jump ship but that never really happened .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`

 What I see a lot in this sub is that many people seem to think there 's little profit to be made with " boring " coins such as BTC and ETH and instead eye at the double digit short term gains of certain alts .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`Keep the moons here on the Reddit Vault , only if you decide to sell them , follow the steps of the many guides out there ( typically it goes something like this : get some free Rinkeby ETH to pay for gas , send moons to your * * Metamask * * wallet ( they show up at the Ethererum Rinkeby testnet account , not mainnet ) , then exchange moons for xmoons and sell on honeyswap .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`You 've been talking about this crypto stuff non - stop and she finally decided to do " her own research " and is following some Telegram group that says Dogecoin is going to 10$. ( If this seems hyperbole to you , I have literal friends in their 20s who have more than 10k invested into Doge and other currently " hot " altcoins , only 10 % BTC and 10 % ETH .`
btc_clueless,neither,Ethereum,`I think he might still live with his dad Dmitry ( who is also on Twitter and actively commenting on crypto stuff , especially Ethereum obviously ) .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 I guess people do n't really care about fundamentals and are more concerned with , " as a hardened investor , let me give you some cliches ... " type posts - I guess a guy who was asking about buying dnt , navcoin and buying btc / eth with gift cards in the 2017 bull run is a ' hardened investor ' now .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Finished ETH 2 is a couple of years away , still , right now it 's just about to launch Phase 0 of ETH 2 . 

 The rollout plan is : 

 Phase 0 contains all of the machinery behind eth2 's PoS consensus , it tracks the validators and their balances .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 Phase 1.5 updates Ethereum as we know it today from PoW to PoS by making it a shard under eth2 .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`This is just signalling that the minimum required amount was reached to launch the beacon chain ( ETH 2 Phase 0 ) .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Do nt forget that the people staking now need to run a validator ( consisting of eth , beacon and validator nodes ) .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`So , it’t not just as simple as sending eth to a contract , but luckily the good folks at ethstaker sub are there to help anyone curious how to do this .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 There s more to it than that ( like having to run the hardware 24/7 which runs eth , beacon and validator nodes ) , but that s the gist .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Interesting , that ETH movement looks a lot like back in January 2018 where it did n’t take off till BTC cooled off .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`BTC cooled off , ETH hit ATH and alts were going crazy .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 For instance , I like ETH and the thing that made me happy about ETH recently was testing out staking on medalla , seeing it in action and then seeing the ETH2 beacon chain launch .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 Seems you want to trade , but with that kind of money you ’ll have to be careful of fees or even GAS once you start moving ETH around to trade on a Dex .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Yeah , they thought that because Grayscale announced they 're [ opening up ETH buys again](https://crypto - bulletin.com/2021/01/31 / grayscale - reopens - ethereum - trust - after - altcoin - registration - bonanza/ )`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that makes it easy to join public networks or create and manage scalable private networks using the popular open - source frameworks   [ Hyperledger Fabric](https://aws.amazon.com / blockchain / what - is - hyperledger - fabric/ ) and Ethereum ( Preview ) .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Smart contracts and DeFi on DAG with Andrew Cronje as a lead dev , but I suppose there are a lot of ETH killers out there .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I ’ll just write a two paragraph post that says , “ PSA : do n’t trust people on twitter who say they ’ll give you more ETH than you send them ” 

 See you at the top !`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`The next " Eth Killer " might well be Eth itself , and I feel this is why [ Vitalik is now pushing to escalate ETH 2.0](https://our.status.im / vitalik - escalates - eth-2 - 0 - merge - as - miners - plan - a-51 - attack/ ) because he knows that Eth no longer is the only game in town .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`It 's not a guarantee and you should know that the Ethtrader community has been guaranteeing that ETH will " explode " since BTC broke it 's 20k ATH , and yet it 's barely gone past its ATH compared to what BTC has done .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 I do n't think Eth goes beyond $ 2k until ETH 2.0 , and even then , there is a risk mindshare is lost to some competitors by that time , which is why i think Vitalik is pushing to escalate 2.0 release .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`ETH because of the promise of ETH2 and the services it might bring to the masses thanks to cheaper PoS setup .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I remember this one from back in 2017 . 

 So , you 're saying that once ETH goes to ETH2 POS , all those miners will jump onto something like Golem ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I do n't think it matters too much if they have or have n't bought ETH .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`60/40 BTC and ETH is a reasonable split , from what I 've seen , most people do closer to 60/30/10 ( remaining 10 on alts ) , but all the same if you could not be bothered following altcoins .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I think it was one of the most hyped ' ETH Killer ' projects out there that has been overtaken by newer projects trying to do the same thing .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`For ETH if you ’re solo staking it means you ’re putting up the 32ETH that allows you to run a beacon and validator node .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`BTC , ETH then any 1 in these categories that you like : platform , layer2 , oracle , defi , nft , supply chain is what I recommend .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`On the “ real world uses ” front , one thing i ’m curious how businesses use ETH if gas varies or a token of the token price explodes ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Who said eth will hit 40 - 100k ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`If its small numbers just stick with eth and btc for now till you can afford more`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I actually remember reading about it and seeing “ world computer ” and “ ether ” and thinking the concept was cool but the name made it sound dodgy .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Careful , vet is spoken of a lot here , most noobies wo nt know what that is , they only know bitcoin , doge and eth .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`ETH is up 10 % and here i was worried that it would dip below 2k yesterday !`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 Listen , I like VET , but ETH is ETH , it is still the number 2 for a good reason .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 Honestly , if you 're going to fork out money for mining ( to anyone thinking of doing so ) , why not just put that money into the market and hodl or even put it into coins you can stake like ETH and do that instead ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Agreed , helps that it 's on it 's own solid path ( ETH 2.0 ) and has ETFs and other big players behind it and viewing it separately from BTC .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`BTC dominance down , alts flying , ETH " flippening " talk / hype coming back .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`True , if eth explodes and btc dominance drops again and alts pump you ’ll know the end of the cycle is near`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`“ Ripping ” 

 Listen , i love ETH , too , but lets not get too excited .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`ETH holders must be pretty happy with how it 's holding up over 24hrs compared to everything else .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I think a lot of us have ptsd from 2018 when things played out in a similar way with alts , btc dominance , and eth rise`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`ETH hit a pretty reasonable ATH given where it is with insane GAS fees .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Are you thinking ETH 2.0 will be the catalyst for it ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Cool site , thanks for sharing , this part was interesting 

 * * Cost of Ethereum 2.0 Validator :* * $ 74,421.44 

 I wonder what a ETH 2.0 validator will cost in the future once it launches ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Yes , although I still find it all very confusing on how this layer-2 stuff will work with ETH 2.0 .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Man , ETH at 5k seems like such a dream right now , maybe we 'll get there this run .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`That would be nice , but I thought that 's still some time away like when ETH 2.0 launches maybe .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Who would 've thought after the weekend we just had that ETH would be back about $ 2.5k USD`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I think ETH is a better indicator of where we are in the bull market right now .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Same as last time , BTC did it 's thing in December , ETH and the alts then took over and then , well , the run was over .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 If ETH does n't get passed $ 2,500 on the daily then it becomes a double top and it 's not going to be an encouraging sign of what s to come , in my opinion .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 So , yeah , I 'm not looking at BTC right now , looking at ETH instead to try and guess where we are on the meme chart .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Current ETH gas fees : 

 * * 45 * * TRADER&lt ; ASAP 

 * * 41 * * FAST&lt ; 2 m 

 * * 37 * * STANDARD&lt ; 5 m 

 Man , that is such an improvement over not too long ago , lol`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`ETH about to break ATH , meanwhile , old man BTC is just rebounding back into a lower high .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm honestly not excited about much in crypto anymore ( living through 2017/2018 + having lost crypto to scams and hacks from 2013 - 2016 made me try and not get too ' into it ' ) but ETH 2.0 is one thing that I 'm very interested to see play out .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 Thing is , you can always just stake in a pool , like [ https://beta.rocketpool.net/](https://beta.rocketpool.net/ ) which is decentralized ( think of it like the uniswap of staking ETH ) 

 I would suggest you check it out and also check out the ethstaker sub , there are a lot of friendly people there happy to help and also a lot of knowledge with staking ETH .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Could be they 've decided that there is more upside potential with ETH than BTC - especially since there has already been one major ' hype ' cycle of media around crypto and BTC in 2017/2018 .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 ETH exploding and alts taking off worries me that were at the same point we were as Jan 2018 , though .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Most expect by the time ETH 2.0 is ready it will be somewhere around 5 % 

 Also , the ethstaker sub is a fantastic community for more info and help about staking .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`ETH has come a long way from being just $ 100 last year .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 EDIT : you 'll also be able to stake as little as 0.01 ETH`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Seems to me like daily has started off on the red and ETH beating $ 3k on a Sunday ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`A few years back VET discussion was blocked here and now it 's pretty much the 3rd most talked about crypto here behind BTC and ETH , right ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Uniswap allows you now to give give your token and the equal amount of ETH to them so they can automate trading .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`You can do the same except you ’re providing a range in which YOUR tokens and ETH you ’ve given them to play with can be used .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`You did n’t list what might be the best option for staking for many : beta.rocketpool.net 

 It ’s decentralized and you can stake as little as 0.01 ETH .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`And now , we play a game called , “ who will be first to post the $ 3k ETH price news ? ”`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I did n’t think ETH would stay above $ 2k until ETH 2.0 .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I thought it would n't stay above $ 2k until at least ETH 2.0 launched .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`I just want to know which post is the official one so we can celebrate and laugh at my pain for thinking ETH wo n't stay above $ 2k this cycle ( or at least until ETH 2.0 )`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Seems weird that no one has made a post or linked to an article to talk about ETH passing $ 3k .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;Can you actually call it decentralized if only the Rich can run it ! 

 Perhaps you 'd be interested in checking out [ beta.rocketpool.net](https://beta.rocketpool.net ) & lt;- decentralised staking , stake as little as 0.01 ETH`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Uses a testnet , see how it easy it is to deposit some ETH and stake !`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`

 I would imagine people will try to find patterns and plot out similar charts with ETH , especially once it separates itself more from BTC or there are new mechanisms like ETH 2.0 launching .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`In the context of ETH mining vs staking and running a validator node .`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;Now you have locked liquidity which is not making you any income because Ethereum price is out of range and your only option is to remove liquidity and adding it again ( \~250 $ in fees ) 

 Hang on , why are the fees so high to remove and re - add the liquidity ?`
MaltMilchek,neither,Ethereum,`Some people are really betting big on ETH 2.0 , I guess ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`fees currently make it unusable imho this is why eth 2.0 is inevitable`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`All ETH 1 will be convereted into ETH 2 automatically from what I understand .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`If we assume that ETH will " go to the moon " re - selling is sub - optimal considering HODL .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 Sure I can re - sell and invest the $ 300 into ETH today .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Let ’s say ETH triples in price tomorrow .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`If anything I ’d argue those DCAing ETH / BTC are doing better than doing strictly alt coins for the “ technology ” .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`That and the crazy high fees for ETH / BTC right now makes it near impossible for mass adoption .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`BTC / ETH reaches ATH expect a 5 - 10 % correction within a week .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Coinbase pro does not do any type of staking ETH or otherwise .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`In addition I do n't think I 'll ever take my coins off coinbase , there 's no reason for me to do so especially with future staking for ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 Even if we assume both ETH and BTC stays at it 's current rate , ETH will start paying out staking rewards soon .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I 'll be honest I have 0 faith in any other coin other than ETH / BTC .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I got laughed at for calling BTC / ETH conservative investments ¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Everyone is going to say BTC and ETH and one extra coin they 're shilling .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm frankly okay with earning less mining on my 1060 and putting money DCA into ETH instead specially since exchanges are offering staking for ETH soon .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`With that said why not just store your life savings in BTC / ETH ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`With that said I 'd rack up as much ETH before 2.0 implementation and move on to rvn coin .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Albeit much easily calculated then that of BTC / ETH however . 

 & gt;There ’s no value in paying invoices with deflationary assets when being invoiced in inflationary fiat 

 Would n't stable coins be deflationary if it 's tied / pegged to the local currency ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Some folks have 0 ETH / BTC as they feel they ca n’t get 500 % returns and it ’s not worth it .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`& gt ;   Between my repeated buying and selling , I 'm about .06 ETH down from where I should be right now .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 .. that 's not even a 4 % profit ... 

 & gt ; I have $ 1000 worth of ETH at 2400 

 Jesus ... you essentially bought in again at ATH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`& gt ; if ETH goes to $ 10,000 

 As a reminder , to make your feel worse , crypto can move up , down , or sideways .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Go with mining ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 Idk what pool you ’re using but generally takes me 5 - 6 weeks to get 0.05 ETH , to pull out .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`* * this time around especially with ETH 2.0 locking up ETH from being traded openly and the reduction of mineable ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 I know they 're burn ETH right now .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`It ’s super easy to setup assuming you have an ETH wallet already it ’s plug and play .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I ’m waiting for ETH staking with Coinbase`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`EIP 1559 and ETH 2.0 would make ETH mining non - existent .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Assuming either of you have ETH in your account .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`If BTC drops slowly over months , I can see ETH continue to rise .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 Actually now that I think about it every exchange may take 5 days for the ACH to clear before you can use the ETH`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`You bet your ass I picked up more ETH when it when to $ 2k and BTC when it went below $ 50k .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 I ’d imagine once ETH 2.0 is released we may get a better answer .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`e.g. you convert ETH to BTC it 's taxable .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Yeah this is why I always convert to ETH or BTC immediately .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`And if you do n't mind me asking , how much ETH do you have staked ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Not to mention you have to trade your ETH in for a wrapped ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Coinbase allows ETH staking with no min .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`If ETH goes up I ’d imagine BTC would go up as well .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 Correct me if I 'm wrong but even with 1559 , it does n't make eth mining undoable , just less profitable .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Does staking 0.01 get your the same return as staking 10 ETH ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`You ’re telling me I can put my ETH into rocketpool and pull out my ETH at any point and even transfer it to a cold wallet if my choosing .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 If I put my 5 ETH into rocket pool for staking today .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`So basically you ’re given rocket bucks for staking your ETH . 

 Although I ’m sure this is 100 % legit , put down your crypto goggles and this sounds like a huge fucking scam from a distance .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I rather have a publicly traded company that ’ll get the full might of the US govt ripping them a new one if they fuck us over vs some neck beards running nodes and giving us bunny dollars in exchange for ETH`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`No . 

 The point being exchanges have enough capital to cover all the staked ETH that you can just pull out at any point .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 Some believe there are no taxes until you sell your staked ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`What makes things worse is exchanging bunny bucks back to ETH is also a taxable event .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I buy more ETH can I then stake the extra amount ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I know ETH is undervalued but this is a lot of activity in a short time period .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`You walk into a crypto sub and they 're gon na pump crypto and say things like ETH / BTC guaranteed .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Doge coin drops to nothing and people lose everything would make a lot of retail investors too timid to go back in even something as worthwhile as ETH or BTC .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`ETH going from 2200 to 3500 in less than 7 days just because some folks are using it does n't .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`People think they 're buying cheap ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`This is why I 'm not buying anymore ETH unless it holds the 3300 mark for at least 2 weeks .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm more surprised that the news was n't affecting BTC but rather ETH as I have n't read anything about institutions buying ETH or even looking at it .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`& gt ;   What about if I mine BTC instead of ETH ? 

 It 'll be worse .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 You can easily just buy $ 3000 worth of ETH now and let it ride for a year and you 'll make more profits than mining it . 

 In addition that hash rate approximation is based on today 's difficulty , as I 've said before the difficulty is going up higher and higher .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`If ETH mining dies your resell value greatly depreciates .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Assuming the US each time you use your ETH for goods and services it creates a taxable event which the user is responsible for tracking the price of ETH at the time of purchase .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Has n't been confirmed yet but one of the reasons for coinbase is they may allow you to pull out your ETH without a wrapped ETH because of coinbase being a 600 billion dollar company .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Rumor has it they should have enough cash to cover just giving you back your ETH when the day comes .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 Everywhere else currently if you want your ETH back after staking would require a wrapped ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`What 's worse is you ca n't sell your wrapped ETH on the main net`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`ETH going up 35 % in a week was scary as fuck to me , but a lot of people would rather post rocket memes vs pondering the risk assesment when a coin grows that much that fast .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Whereas you 'll get a wrapped ETH staking in a pool which creates a taxable event .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`

 For loving decentralization , we 're sure as fuck okay with centralizing our ETH .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`They have large enough bags where they can offer to let us out of the staking contract without wrapped eth .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Can you comment on how ETH mines 18 million new coins a year , while DOGE mines 14 million new coins * * per day * * ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Your liable for all gains 

 You then sell you converted ETH , you ’re liable for all gains from the price that you converted from BTC .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`I ’ve commented before about not buy ETH as I ’m quite frightened that it did 35 % in less than a week .`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Do you actually think we ’re getting ETH 2.0 in July ?`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Oh wo n’t happen by month ’s end like all the ETH focused subs are telling me ? 

 Shocking ...`
johnny_fives_555,neither,Ethereum,`Like staking ETH for wrapped ETH for instance .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`The true impact is already there for those who actually want to see it : 


 - ETH does more transactions than Bitcoin 
 - ETH has a Zk rollups live now on Loopring layer 2 that allows instant and free transactions

BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin is the first mover without technological advancements backed by the shady institutions trying to make sure underdog ETH does n't beat it , we can change that .`

 This means like in the ETH case people buying it to use it ( DeFi , NFT , Games , Dexes , Staking , .... ) 

 What you described is the normal demand , again people hoping to offload at a higher price on others .`

BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`BSC has alleged more traffic , it 's a centralised copy of Ethereum so there is now way to verify if its all real volume .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`At one point Pancakeswap was showing an ETH price that was from a week ago .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`

 The problem is that BSC has no devs of their own so they have to wait for Ethereum updates to be able to copy them , but in specific cases like this they ca n't quickly solve it so their solution now was to write out a bounty for anyone who was able to solve that .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`Developers have created decentralised apps on top of Ethereum so you can use these services without having to trust a middleman .`

BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`The king is dead , long live the new king ETH !`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`If you would 've transferred more then that action would only have made more sense as the fee would still have been 10$.

BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`Where did all those " ETH is completely unusable " folks go ? 
 And the real scaling improvements planned next months are not even live yet .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`

 On top of that they ca n't even properly run it correctly as they copied the full Ethereum code and removed limits they do n't understand which caused the infra to overload and Pancakeswap being over 1mil blocks behind .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`Because you missed the boat on ETH and want to think ADA can perform the same .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine being in crypto and not holding ETH or understanding that it basically fuels 90 % of this space .`
BakedEnt,favor,Ethereum,`ETH almost flipped BTC in 2017 and that was without the insane use cases and updates it has this year .`

 It does n't mean that ETH is doomed to fail , it just shows that there are issues to be resolved to improve mainstream adoption .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH miners having power does n't make it centralized .`

Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I think they do support ETH staking , but I could be wrong .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Pretty much every exchange ( that I could find ) has double digit ETH network fees for withdrawing to a wallet you own .`

Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll send you a couple moons to mess around with while we wait for the next distribution ! 

 Currently , the only option for withdrawing moons for Fiat requires multiple mainnet ETH transactions , which comes with gas fees .`

Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Kraken has withdrawal fees for ETH that are lower than gas fees ( idk how they do it and still make a profit ) , which is why I 'm less hesitant to convert it to ETH than to wait for Moons to hit the mainnet .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd feel more comfortable with leaving it in BTC or ETH for the exact reason you mentioned .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`The other day , I got some ETH on Kraken and the withdrawal fee was 0.0017 ETH .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I believe they can coexist assuming each platform 's highly anticipated updates go smoothly ( Alonzo for Cardano , and Optimism for ETH ) .`

Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I sell it for ETH at $ 2100 and look what it does .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I doubt moons are going to go to the mainnet until ETH gas fees are greatly reduced .`

Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`In fact , these fees are incurred because of ETH 's decentralization .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's a side effect of how ETH does PoW smart contracts .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm not using smart contracts or moving ERC20 tokens by moving my ETH from a wallet to an exchange .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`That requires a bunch of complex actions on the network as opposed to moving ETH once .`

 170 gwei is for moving ETH .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH2.0 is our best bet at getting to use ETH as it 's meant to be used .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`That s why they 're releasing eth 2.0 .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`KEVM should allow dApps to migrate from ETH to Cardano easily , so hopefully its growth will be sustained with new projects coming to the platform .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`If this happens before ETH 2.0 is released , it would make the Cardano network a good alternative to Ethereum due to its lower prices and established Proof of Stake network .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker ) shows that fast ETH transactions only cost \~$13 USD .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`DYOR of course , but I expect the price of ETH to go up once ETH 2.0 is released .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Assuming all goes to plan , ETH 2.0 should make gas fees more reasonable , which would make the entire ETH ecosystem accessible to more people , not just the whales .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`It 'll also switch the network to Proof of Stake , which is much more environmentally friendly and allows anyone holding ETH to earn APY based on their holdings .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's on the Rinkeby testnet , which means that the gas fees are paid with Rinkeby testnet ETH , which is free .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I would 've never guessed that the wallets with more ETH hold more ETH than the wallets with less ETH .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm claiming I do n't have enough ETH to pay the gas fee and I asked him to pay my gas fee so I can invest .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I lead him in circles asking about ETH gas fees , then offered to pay with DOGE , then " accidentally sent " 60 K DOGE to his BTC address , then sent him a " transaction confirmation " QR code leading to Rick Astley 's " Never Gon na Give You Up " .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH have pretty substantial network fees at the moment , so you might have to leave the funds on whichever exchange you 're using before you withdraw to a wallet you own .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I definitely think it will , especially if smart contracts go live before ETH 2.0 is released .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Repeat 

 This would allow me to DCA every week while stacking up on BTC , ETH , Moons , and whatever altcoin looks appealing at the time , all without losing the 20 % bonus .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 will switch the network to Proof of Stake , so there wo n't be any miners .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`This means that all fees are paid using Rinkeby ETH , which is free to produce and has no value .`

 One thing to note is that Rinkeby ETH transactions are incredibly low compared to mainnet ETH transactions , but the fee is still there ( 1.5 gwei , or   0.000157236 Ether ) .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`

 The transaction fee is there , it 's just paid with Rinkeby ETH .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I can see that my wallet was given 3 Rinkeby ETH , but it seems to be after one of the distributions .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I 've used Kraken for withdrawing ETH , and the fee is only 0.0017 ETH .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think either of the networks is trying to be an " ETH - killer " .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I think people are optimistic for ETH 2.0 and all of the increased adoption that comes with affordable gas fees .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`There 's also KEVM , which would make it easy for ETH projects to migrate to the Cardano network .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't see Cardano overthrowing ETH , but this could convince projects to move to the network ( especially if Alonzo is released before ETH 2.0 .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm not sure if other networks are doing something similar , but it allows users to pay fees with the native token used in the transaction instead of relying on the network currency like ETH does .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`I really like the idea of paying for a decentralized swap with one of the currencies used in the transaction instead of paying the fee with ETH .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`In the meantime , I 'm stacking up in hopes that smart contracts will boost the price further , though I suppose it 's a bit more risky than an already established network like ETH .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin and Ethereum might be the most popular cryptocurrencies at the moment , but their fees make them pretty bad for everyday transactions and purchases .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Charles Hoskinson has made it clear that Cardano is n't meant to be an ETH competitor .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are the safest bets , but I also recommend looking into some other coins in the top 50 by market cap to see if there are any projects that look promising .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Charles Hoskinson has made it clear that Cardano is not meant to be an ETH killer .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`With the network 's lower fees and the K Ethereum Virtual Machine ( KEVM ) , we 'll probably see ome Ethereum dApps expand to the Cardano network .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Grayscale holds 13x more in ETH than ETC . 

 & gt;The fundamental difference is in security vs. efficiency ; Ethereum is built on boosting the performance of the original blockchain , while Ethereum Classic is focused on maintaining its smart contracts secure .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is switching to a Proof of Stake network soon , which will greatly reduce the fees .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`Charles Hoskinson has said that Cardano is n't meant to be an ETH killer .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`People see that it has " Bitcoin " or " Ethereum " in the name and that the price is significantly lower than the true Bitcoin or Ethereum and think they 're getting a better deal .`
Gabgra11,favor,Ethereum,`My interpretation is that Cardano has been working on making banking more accessible to all and Ethereum is more focused on decentralized apps and supporting a decentralized internet .`

pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`High ETH fees is why we now accept LTC and ICX .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Not against BTC 's high consumption rate per se but there 's value in what Nano and ICX are doing and what ETH is trying to do .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`As a Bitcoin OG , here 's what I observed the /r / bitcoin camps to break down in to ( excluding the hardcore maxis ): 

 Those who got in due to tech : BTC and ETH 

 Those who got in due to libertarian leanings : BTC and XMR 

 Those who got in due to p2p / business : BTC and LTC / Nano 

 You can be a mix of these .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`With current BTC not being what Satoshi 's whitepaper intended , it only makes sense for ETH to outpace BTC .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`

 With that said , with the current Bitcoin not being what Satoshi 's whitepaper intended is one of the reasons why I started using Ethereum ( it was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin during that time ) .`

pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Atleast you can see Ethereum changing poor people 's lives .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Maybe they 're waiting for mainnet Ethereum to get it 's act straight .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`These gas fees are what 's holding Ethereum back from a trillion dollar market cap valuation .`

 For the topic , my favorite coin that 's not Ethereum is a interoperability project that 's already delivering what some coins are just promising .`

 Litecoin is fast 

 Icon ICX is within a second as well - we paid a lawyer with ICX a week ago 

 The problem ones are Bitcoin ( we have a payment that has not yet arrived for 3 days since the customer used to default low fee ) 

 Hope Ethereum becomes cheap again - we did a lot of Ethereum transactions back in 2017`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`

 Too many to mention , but here 's one glaring one : 

 * Do you think solid projects like Ethereum and Nano would put a rap video by a no name rapper they probably paid on Fiverr on their front page as a marketing tool ?`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Coins like Ethereum can be crypto assets 

 Coins like Nano / Litecoin can be crypto currency`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Depends on how cheap and fast Ethereum will be in the future .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`That 's why I 'm accumulating as much ETH as I can before it goes POS .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Exchange buying is not on chain so its not affected until you withdraw to your own wallet 

 It 's why we only accepted Ethereum payments for a time back then .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Congratulations on joining the 1 ETH club !`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`Newbies think it 's a cheaper Ethereum .`
pinoygs,neither,Ethereum,`If Ethereum becomes cheap to transact again , we may see the flippening sooner than later .`

Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`DOT will be in top 3 in 2021 , once people actually see it ’s an allready working ecosystem and with solid projects launching on it people will start comparing it to ETH .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH has a potential to grow .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`

 People will think : “ -oh , no btc is too expensive also ETH , what coins are cheaper ? ”`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`It will connect with ETH it ’s a win win .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`I also sold some SNX after it mooned the first time and bought ETH not sure if that was the smartest move either .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Lets remember ETH might have been an alt before but it has a huge usecase in crypto today .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Has anyone said ETH will pump today hitting ATH ?`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`  That ’s like comparing ETH BTC`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Banks and institutions hodling their BTC bags : ” -wait , wat?!What is ETH ! ?`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`I went to bed   an everything was going to get ready for a moonshot and ETH almost hitting ath .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`There are so many projects launching on it , it ’s not only some hype it ’s undervalued and will bring ETH more power .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH !`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`It depends how you look at it , Polkadot is solid and if you compare it to ETH as a financial ecosystem which it is and striving to be then it ’s still in price discovery , there are some exciting projects building on Polkadot .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Look , DOT , ADA and ATOM are expanding the economic ecosystems that ETH has laid the groundwork for , this is extremly positive for crypto as a whole and people that do n’t understand it or ca n’t have an unbiased opinion about is because they are so deep in only one of these projects that ca n’t handle     somebody not mentioning the ecosystem they ’ve invested in .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Dexes gives you the possibility to buy coins that have n’t launched on CEXes so many times there is a greater possibility to make gains if you find a good coin with good fundamentals and a use case before they end up on CEXEs but research is required , some people get scammed on DEXes because there are people listing scam coins that are similar to steal your ETH , that is why you need to use etherscan so you end up at the right and true project 

 Crypto .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Compared to where BTC is sitting atm ETH is def undervalued .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has gas fees BTC have miner fees`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`

 This is why following BTC and ETH everyday is important to see the signals .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has n’t had an insane rally yet ,   companies are discovering Crypto and potential of investing it only Tesla .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t hodl any BNB , but we know ETH has had an increase in traffic .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Also the disbelief in ETH makes people start looking around for something that can help and ease off the stress on the ETH network .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Sure ETH 2.0 is coming but it ’s becoming more apparent that we need more than one ecosystem to run this place .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`If you do n’t like your bag you sell BUT not at a loss , play that mindgame again with yourself when ETH hits another ATH .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`There is still so much ADA needs to do to even be close to ETH , it ’s basically years of development .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s be realistic for a second ADA might want to have a working platform before we can talk about overtaking ETH in reality .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure when ETH 2.0 launches but there ’s that potential there for a potential pump .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Some will most likely sell some ETH , now guess where some of that profit will end up ?`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Ankr , once ETH 2.0 hits it will do well most likely , it still have n’t a massive pump mostly just organic growth`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`That was n’t even what people said , they said : ” -ADA is going to take over ETH ! ”`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Well it ’s not “ just a ETH token ” , it ’s much more .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`
 The ecosystem is not about “ winning ” over ETH it ’s about expanding crypto .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`

 And ETH is ETH long term I have zero doubt about it it ’ll   just keep growing slowly .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`DOT , ANKR , MATIC , FTM , SOL I hodl BTC and ETH of course but more fun to show off the altcoins imo .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`  Developers have made sure it ’s interoperable with ETH so liquidity can easily flow between these two .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Do the opposite dca into BTC let it hit a ATH sell of and buy more ETH if it consolidates .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`

 This is why DOT , ETH , BNB and most likely ADA and SOL are going to be major players in the future .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Considering how well ETH is doing .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`People that know they know what Matic does , just wait when ETH goes on a real run .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Just let ETH go , we will see BTC ath soon enough .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`  dude ETH and many other coins will be melting your face off by the end of July`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`I always hodl ETH , 
 when it comes to DOT and ADA I have the timeline in mind .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Remember when ADA was supposed to take over ETH in february , I remember .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m bullish on both ETH 2.0 and DOT these 2 are really going to make this space grow , and DOT is needed to expand this space .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Just a friendly reminder ETH , BTC and altcoins matter some altcoins are making crypto even better .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s scaling solution for ETH it ’s great do n’t sleep on it too long it can be worth a lot more soon .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s inevitable not only does it scale ETH it also speeds up AAVE transactions .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Some dude that made a couple of million dollars said that his “ hustling ” barely gave more returns then just hodling an asset like ETH .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`And how slowly ETH has been following BTC it ’s time for ETH rn .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`People will def mine other coins but ETH is very “ hot ” to mine so I think we ’ll see lower prices on GPUs .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`This is fomo you are experiencing 🤓 , just hodl your alts rn , and maybe dca into some ETH when it corrects , I needs to have a pitstop at some point I believe .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`ETH sure but skeptical about ADA reaching $ 6 but hey one time in history XRP had a larger market cap than BTC for a brief period so who knows really .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Is Moons on uniswap with a ETH pair or am I dreaming ?`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Lets allt thank Matic for better gas fees first BTC rallies , then ETH , then altcoins go ballistic .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`This makes the whole ETH ecosystem faster but also helps with congestion on the network .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Too much ETH in here I ’m happy about it but BTC and ETH going up is pretty predictable during a Bullrun I ’m more excited by the smaller cap alts I hodl that ’s where the “ monster gains ” are .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`This is how the Bullmarket works people get bored of BTC trading sideways and go into the next coin like ETH and once they get bored with ETH after a while they go to smaller cap alts .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Matic it ’s undervalued for freaking making ETH awesome again`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`My ETH stack is up 202 % not that bad but compared some alts that are up 2000 % , what ’s all the fuzz about ?`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Still it requires lots of liuidity to move the way it has and it has the momentum rn but still a +150 % On ETH most likely wo nt happen overnight , I think that is important to remember to be realistic about it .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Most of us know it ’s doing great work for ETH and it will keep doing a good job .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s mostly pumping because people think they are smart buying “ cheap ” ETH it ’s pretty random`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Apparently People that have n’t seen an altcoin besides Doge before think it ’s like buying ETH on black friday 🙃 
 Tip : It ai n’t`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`I do n’t need god to know that matic is a great scaling solution for ETH .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`That ’ll make ETH deflationary .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`You can more or less see where it starts by looking at the BTC chart , then again the altcoin season is really starting to rev up atm ETH was a pretty solid indicator of that .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`BTC will go parabolic at some point , we will def go beyond 100k this Bullrun but altszn just started for real when ETH woke up`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`You can still get rug pulled or scammed from your ETH .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`New retail sees word ” Ethereum ” thinking it ’s the same but cheaper .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`This is a reckless strategy , sure if it was a coin with strong fundamentals and usecases but ETC is the outdated version of ETH and when ETH 2.0 hits you wo nt be able to even compare these two .`
Spacedude2187,favor,Ethereum,`Thanks motherfucker we ’ll get it to $ 10 soon enough Matic is not only scaling for ETH but speeding   up transactions speeds on plattforms like AAVE .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`ATH only matters if you bought at the ATH 

 ETH has been consistently outperforming BTC for the past 2 years`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I disagree , Ethereum is n't an alternative to Bitcoin`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`ADA certainly wo n't face the same centralization issues that EOS has 

 But I 'm not sure how ADA will gain network effects and not just become another " Ethereum killer " ghost chain like Tezos .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Calling ETH an altcoin is like calling a pear an altfruit`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 xDai has a federated bridge to Ethereum mainnet , nobody is going to trust that bridge with large amounts of money .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`It 's certainly a lot better than most of the coins in the top 10 

 1st gen blockchains : Bitcoin , Litecoin , etc  
 2nd gen blockchains : Ethereum , Tezos , EOS etc  
 3rd gen blockchains : Polkadot , Cosmos`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Exactly ! 

 I put my ETH & amp ; BTC in Maker , draw dai , and withdraw cash using my crypto.com card 

 It is 2 % APR , but the gains easily make up for that .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`BTC is up 254 % YTD 

 ETH up 385 % YTD 

 I 'm sure we can each cherry pick timeframes to show BTC outperforming ETH or vice versa 

 The point is they both have strong futures .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`It 's just strange for me to see " I see no point holding ETH " , when personally I feel it has way more potential upside than BTC`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Visa is n't competing with gold , just like Ethereum is n't competing with Bitcoin 

 I do n't think we 're going to agree on this debate , so I guess we 'll just wait and see who 's right :)`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin is trying to be digital gold , Ethereum is trying to be a platform for the global financial system .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`You could have bought at $ 90 in March 

 I bought 1 or 2 ETH at around $ 100 this year , wish I bought more`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 By depositing 32 ETH , people can run validator nodes for the Ethereum network , securing the chain and earning rewards .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Setting up a staking rig is much simpler than a miner ( you just need a decent computer , an SSD , internet connection & amp ; 32 ETH )`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 Of course , MakerDAO requires SoV assets like ETH & amp ; BTC to back it .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Great metaphor for both communities 

 Bitcoin : " We shall tear down the entrenched institutions ! " 

 Ethereum : Unicorns , rainbows , pepe frogs & amp ; Mr. F was here`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is n't a bet on the collapse of the global economy , Ethereum is a bet on the growth of a new technology .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 On Twitter , the author of the bill said that miners and node operators censor transactions from unregulated stablecoins , and that the Ethereum Foundation should apply for a banking license .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I mean , it 's reeeealy slow , but it 's still usable 

 Bitcoin has given up on it 's goal of being " cash " , but that does n't mean it ca n't be " money " 

 Plus , ironically , Bitcoin scales just fine by being wrapped and put on Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I imagine voting on the Ethereum blockchain would use a custom rollup solution 

 According to Vitalik in his comment above : 

 & gt ; Eth2 sharding ( even data sharding alone ) is sufficient ; its data layer would be able to process all votes for an election with 100 M voters in less than 1 day`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; This is literally the first place that I have seen what blockchain platform this project is built on 

 If you see a news article about " blockchain " , 90 % of the time they 're talking about Ethereum without using its name .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`The " ETH is digital oil " is a bit of a dated , 2017 narrative .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is much more useful than just paying transaction fees .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 The " Triple Point Asset " thesis is probably the best at defining ETH 's use case & amp ; monetary premium .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is a very safe investment ( it already beats BTC in many metrics such as value transferred and total fees ) , you should definitely make sure you have some substantial allocation there .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll be the first to admit it , I 'm a huge ETH supporter 

 The difference is that I see ETH everywhere .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm not convinced that marginally better tech will be able to overcome the massive network effects that Ethereum has .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`This is a big security issue , which I believe is why we have n't seen much adoption of those bridges , or of Bitcoin on Liquid / RSK , or Ethereum assets on xDai ( all similar security profiles ) .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 Only time will tell , but I do n't think ETH is going to crash on account of CME futures .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`The SEC said that Ethereum is " sufficiently decentralized " , therefore not a security .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I hate the tribalism between Bitcoin , Ethereum , other chains , etc . 

 But at the same time , I think XRP is a symbol of how immature the crypto industry is .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; ETH does n’t even have PoS 

 PoS went live in the beginning of the month , the chains just have n't merged yet 

 & gt ; or anything for governance 

 The Ethereum community is against on - chain governance , since it ends up as an oligarchy .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Funding development with inflation is an idea that the Ethereum community toyed with , but was ultimately rejected , it 'll be interesting to see how it plays out with Cardano ( as well as other projects like ZCash ) .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`If you 're curious how Ethereum governance works , here 's a good first step : 

 https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/ 

 & gt ; And what exactly is Binance 's and Kraken 's motivation of funding ?`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 The Ethereum community has built a system where a company can easily put money into a pool & amp ; let the community decide how to allocate it , as opposed to having to divert resources to allocating that money .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`A wire transfer in the US costs $ 15 

 Banks do n't care about a $ 2 Ethereum fee to send millions of dollars .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`The SEC announced ETH is not a security years ago 

 Any ETH investors have made incredible gains ( from $ 0.20 to $ 1000 ) 

 Who are you mad at ?`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin growth is being driven by institutional investors , while ETH 's value prop has expanded to being used as collateral in DeFi + staking in Eth2 + fee burn when EIP1559 is implemented .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`MakerDAO being built on Ethereum is like Email being built on the Internet ( TCP / IP )`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Energy use is n't the problem , Ethereum is moving to PoS and Bitcoin will become powered by renewables & amp ; unused energy as the market matures .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`If Bitcoin is email , Ethereum is the web 

 By almost all metrics except for market cap , Ethereum is the dominant blockchain , many other cryptocurrencies are running on top of the Ethereum blockchain`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`It 's exactly _ because _ Ethereum has potential to improve and grow that makes it an exciting investment .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`But still , ADA 's value is entirely speculation on it being used in the future , while BTC & amp ; ETH are at least _ partially _ valued based on their high usage today .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; its about acknowledging that if your product misses a big demographic or creates friction ( in this case , cost to use ) there is a chance someone will try to fill the gap 

 Ethereum _ is _ trying to fill that gap .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`PoS is not more scalable than PoW 

 Ethereum is n't scaling by switching to PoS , they 're scaling by adding sharding and developing layer 2 solutions .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`It 's also interesting that the top " ETH killers " by market cap are Polkadot and Cardano , neither of which support smart contracts yet .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 Out of all the valuable projects on Ethereum , none of them were " partnerships " , they were all new projects that decided to build on Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`EY is clearly investing a lot of money into the Ethereum ecosystem , but I 'm still not sure that it 's affecting the network or price of ETH much .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Sure , but ETH vs ADA feels to me like TSLA vs NKLA 

 One has actually built a product , and is planning on improving it , the other one has n't built a product yet .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I think Ethereum will be the " central " blockchain , the settlement layer that all other blockchains connect to .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`It 's clearly already moving in that direction , a significant amount of Bitcoin is settled on Ethereum , and every new blockchain is building a bridge to Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`It 's clear that Binance chain wo n't steal users from Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`The better question is will it steal users & amp ; developers from competing " Ethereum Killers " 

 Many projects like Tezos & amp ; Cardano have marketed themselves saying that " fees are too high on Ethereum " .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll believe you if we start seeing major projects launching on BSC ( that are n't funded by Binance ) 

 Right now most projects are counting on Ethereum rollups launching soon & amp ; bringing down transaction fees .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`That means if the network is being heavily used , ETH issuance can go _ negative _ .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 Aztec is n't a privacy coin , it 's just an application running on Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`No government is going to ban Ethereum , so that means they ca n't ban Aztec .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum has the nice situation of 5 + years of PoW mining before switching to PoS. But the capital costs of Ethereum 's PoS are still much higher than the capital costs of purchasing Bitcoin mining equipment .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 The difference is that Optimism is secured by Ethereum , while Polygon has its own token and own security mechanism .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; fees compounded by the price increase 

 That 's not true , fees move independent of ETH price`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`This is generally not considered part of " Eth2 " , however it is another major upgrade to Ethereum , and I could see it being marketed under the " Eth2 " umbrella .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; as more and more tokens move away from ethereum and get their own main net that transactions will get cheaper 

 If tokens move away from Ethereum faster than new tokens are created on Ethereum than yes .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`But I doubt that will happen , Ethereum is still the epicenter of the crypto economy .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; when someone sends a token from one user to another , what actually gets moved ? 

 Imagine two rows in a spreadsheet , one for account A and one for account B. 

 If you send a token from A -&gt ; B , then the spreadsheet will decrease the balance of A and increase the balance of B. 

 And the computer that 's running the spreadsheet is Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Dogecoin is it 's own blockchain 

 However , there are " tokenized " coins on Ethereum , such as renDOGE or WBTC .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`This lets you use assets that are on separate blockchains inside of Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 And also , ETH 's price is n't just dependent on ETH for paying fees .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`I imagine those provide much more value to ETH than just fees .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 It 's much easier for developers to build tokens on top of Ethereum instead of building their own blockchain , just like it 's much easier for developers to build a website instead of building their own internet protocol .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 Those were what inspired Vitalik to build Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; The fact that the technical shortcomings of ETH have created this ludicrous fee market is bad 

 It 's not a technical shortcoming , it 's just the reality of a high - demand blockchain .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 _ ( yes , other chains have marginal scalability improvements , but OP would still be complaining if they lost $ 60 vs $ 90 ) _ 

 The reality is that Ethereum L1 is in an awkward transition point into becoming a settlement layer .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Those protocols all do very different things 

 Blockchains that have different purposes do n't compete , such as Bitcoin & amp ; Ethereum , I 'd even say that Polkadot is different enough from Ethereum to not directly compete .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`

 But it 'll be much harder for " Ethereum killers " like Solana , Tezos & amp ; Cardano to pull meaningful marketshare from Ethereum when there 's not much differentiating them .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Interesting how the high fees on Ethereum pushed all the scams & amp ; ponzis to BSC , while legit projects continue to deploy on Ethereum .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`If you 're new , just stick to Bitcoin & amp ; Ether , ca n't go wrong with those .`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`Vitalik seems to get credit for everything that happens with Ethereum , but this one should go to Peter from Geth for making sure it was safe to increase the gas limit`
eastsideski,favor,Ethereum,`So the more DeFi is used , the more ETH gets locked away in vaults , pools , etc .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`seeing a bunch of comments about eth not keeping up with btc right now . just fyi , eth is up 254 % ytd .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`btc is up 125 % ytd . also , i posted [ this](https://www.reddit.com / r / CryptoCurrency / comments / jrx2m7 / daily_discussion_november_11_2020_gmt0 / gbyi0bw/?context=3 ) yesterday : 

 " during the last bull market , btc hit an all time high 1 month before eth did .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`

 then , as btc started to come off the high , eth took off , going from \~$700 to + $ 1400 in less than a month 

 hopium : eth will run and run hard after btc hits new ath "`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`

 i think eth is the future .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`for me , i 'll sell eth in increments ... at 2x ath , i 'll sell 20 % 

 and then continue to sell in 10 % increments for every 20 % gain 

 that being said , i 'm keeping at least 32 eth for what is yet to come`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i noticed that [ beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in ) changed the eth genesis date to a range 

 now , it 's estimated to occur between 01 dec 2020 and 02 feb 2021 

 i sure do hope that the amount of deposits starts to increase soon`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth is the right horse 

 not many coins pump when btc is pumping ... just be patient and everyone will pour their btc into other coins again ...`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i do n't think it will ... there a a large amount of holders that have 1000s of eth .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`

 imo , holders with smaller amounts of eth ( 100 or less , which is prob a majority of reddit users ) would prob not want to lock up 32 eth .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`let 's go , eth 

 there 's a precedent for this 

 last cycle , when btc went beast mode and hit 17k , eth followed , going from mid $ 400s to $ 700s pretty quickly ... then , after btc hit ath , eth went from $ 700 up to $ 1400 in about a month`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`agree ... 

 got some fiat ( well , it 's really dai ) ready to buy more eth`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`we 'll prob hit and surpass ath in btc , then , we 'll trend sideways for a bit . eth and alts will take off .... then , correction 

 rinse and repeat`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i 'm an eth bull , but ethbtc ratio right now is under .03 

 that 's some massive , massive growth on eth 's part 

 one can hope`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i think btc will correct at ath 

 then trend sideways for a while and let eth and alts catch up 

 rinse and repeat`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`when i first got into crypto , it was the spring of 2017 

 first buy was ltc , then some btc , and finally eth 

 then , the face melting rallies started to happen 

 i 'm ready for that to happen again 

 let 's go`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth contract address has surpassed 25 % of required deposits for genesis 

 \~12k deposits left`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`needs to cool off , bro ... 
 and let eth and alts have a run`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`seeing everything pump 20 - 30 % ... 

 eth has n't had one of those pumps ... yet 

 it 'll happen`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`deposits are rolling in consistently right now 
 every time i refresh etherscan , there are at least 20 pending deposits and the amount of deposited eth is higher and higher ...`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`it 'd be nice for eth to close the gap to ath 

 we 're still off over 50 % from ath 

 btc is off less than 10 %`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`well , i 'd love to see that 
 b / c , imo , eth will have a similar % gain`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i do n't think eth is going to drop to $ 80 again if btc drops by 20 %`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i figured that sub was created by a maxi that felt threatened by eth`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i just bought some at 591 

 i was n't going to buy anymore after eth went over 400 , but guess it wo n't hurt , especially if we pop off from here ...`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`contract [ address](https://etherscan.io / address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa ) closing in on 400k eth deposits 

 currently at 398k 

 that 's 1/4 of a billion dollars , folks 

 eta : just went over 400k`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`many   coins are not close to ath 
 for example , eth is over 50 % off`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`do n't be ... it'll take off again ... 

 this is how crypto works 

 btc runs , eth and alts tank , btc rests , eth and alts take off , rinse and repeat`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`there 's * alot * of eth locked up now ... 

 $ 320 m worth of eth in the deposit contract ... for around 1 year 

 and more and more eth getting locked up in defi and cdp 

 excited to see where this could go`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth 2 is a huge upgrade to eth . basically , going from proof of work to proof of stake . in other words , you wo n't be mining eth anymore ( which uses huge amounts of energy ) . simplistically put , you 'll be validating transactions on the blockchain and earning eth for doing so .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`parakite is cool , man ... 

 the 10th man rule 

 glad to be part of eth history , though`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`anyone can validate with a fairly modest computer and still earn eth . to stake , you need 32 eth , but pools ( partial staking ) allow you to earn rewards with the eth you have .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`if you run on your computer ,   you have to meet certain criteria ... 32 eth , hardware minimums , uptime ... you can join a pool if you do n't own 32 and let them worry about the details ... they'll charge something like 15 % of your rewards .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`last time eth was ~$69b market cap , it went parabolic to ath ( $ 1400ish ) within 2 weeks`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`ada is a solid project ... and good luck to ada and those holding it , but i doubt it 'll flip eth 

 pretty much the most development and new innovations are happening on eth 

 also going to add that i do n't think eth will flip btc , but i do think btc and eth will be the top two cryptos moving forward ... that 's just me , though`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i do n't know if that was from github , or a total of commits 

 however , the most commits for the past year belong to lisk , link , and aelf 

 the most developers belong to eth ( more than 200 ) , btc ( about 50 ) , and a few other coins ( about 25 per coin )`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i know the market cooled off a little , but check this out : 

  closing in on 800k eth deposited and 25k validators !`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`[ face melting](https://media.giphy.com / media / f1TFEUu52Ntp6 / giphy.gif ) gains 

 go eth`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`cnbc did not do a good job of keeping [ this](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01 / ethereum-2point0 - eth - cryptocurrencys - network - starts - a - major - upgrade.html ) article about the eth2 upgrade simple 

 most of us that have an i.t . background , or that have been in the crypto space for some time , can follow .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`the average joe will read this and not know what the hell they just read 

 cnbc should have just said that eth was undergoing a major upgrade that allows investors ( holders ) to earn interest while supporting a faster , more efficient network .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`well , booked a family christmas vacation ( a holiday , for you non american readers ) using some profits from eth 

 so looking forward to ending 2020 on a positive note after such a shitty overall year ...`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth market cap dominance in 2020 :

 glad   to see eth make up some of the lost market cap dominance during its   recent rally .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth , then btc with what you have left`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`if you stake eth , it gets locked up until phase 1.5 

 this is known 

 there are some pools that may allow you to unstake , but i do n't think they 're supposed to go live until next year`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth and put it into staking for longer than 6 months`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i think we have to see btc hit a new ath first ... prob a 25k or some other symbolic number ... then , it drops or trades sideways for a while and lets eth and alts go on a run to their own aths .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`the bull run will end after btc goes parabolic ( eth and alts will follow and make face melting gains )`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`as eth and btc become more mature , they wo n't make the parabolic gains we 've seen in the past ... alts will make huge gains ( and losses ) ...`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`for eth , it 's  

     = CRYPTOFINANCE("ETH / USD " ) 

 with excel , you have to add a link to a page ( for example : [ eth](https://www.coingecko.com / en / coins / ethereum ) ) using : data&gt;from web , then linking the cell you want to auto update to the data retrieved .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth is experiencing what can only be called pent up aggression ... ♥`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`wratio wrecked 

 come on eth`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`not sure why , but btc hitting ath 's does n't do it for me that much ... 

 i 'll be jumping up and down when eth does , though`

 eth market cap dominance in 2020 :

 eth market cap dominance in 2021 : 

 jan 01 : 10.7 % 

 since   dec 01 , 2020 , eth is up about 22 % , but has not been able to keep up with btc 's 53 % rally and has , thus , lost about 1.4 % of market dominance .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`it 's a very exclusive club 

 eth has been part of it a few times`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`first bull run ( 2013 ) saw the crypto market cap peak out around $ 15b 

 the second ( 2017 ) peaked around $ 850b 

 //beer math follows 

 that was \~50x 

 i do n't know that we 're going to peak out around $ 50 t this time around ( another 50x ) , but would be pretty happy with a 5x , or around $ 5 t 

 i guess that 'd put btc around 100k , and eth around 7k 

 we 'll see`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`damn ... was trying to generate more dai for the dip and i missed it 

 i think there will be several chances to pick up eth as btc will prob hit 40k and dip several more times`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i 'm almost 100 % eth and love you for saying that`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i 'm almost 100 % in eth ... almost 

 hoping for a 2x ath in the coming months ... 

 wet dream is 3x ath this year 

 tantric wet dream heart attack is $ 10k`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`this past year , i was buying eth in the low $ 100-$600 range ... 

 during that time , xtz is n't even up 100 % .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`glad to see uni is coming back 

 when the airdrops hit , i sold 3 of them for an average of just over $ 7 and converted to eth right away .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`over the last year , eth went from $ 130 to $ 1300 , a 10x , and it did n't reach ath 

 i think it 's safe to say that a lot of ppl think eth will 2 - 3x its ath this year 

 some ppl think it 'll 10 - 15x ( from now until late next year ) the current price of $ 1.2k`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i rec'd a little over $ 8k and put into eth ... i think eth was around 550 usd at the time`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`whales go stop loss fishing ... they'll take your eth , then pump the price back up 

 but , you do you ... a profit is a profit`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`well , it has gone 12x since then , that 's an outstanding return for any investment 

 that being said , many , including me , are expecting eth to at least 2 - 3x from here 

 lots of others think it 'll do much more`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`looks like some volume coming in , but not sure if eth is ready to convincingly break out yet`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`that 's what has been happening with eth , if you look ... 

 i hold a very small bag of xlm ( earn on cb ) , but may take a look at it now and increase bags ...`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`eth is the best crypto blue chip investment of this decade 

 nothing comes close 

 as it gets closer to eip 1559 , pos , and layer 2 scaling , we 're ( imo ) going to see some pretty nice gains over the course of the coming years ... prob more face melting than we 've seen so far this decade 

 btc was the investment of a lifetime last decade ... it 's eth this time around 

 sure , we 're going to have ups and downs based off crypto cycles , but this tech has the possibility of upending industries once it is more mature 

 good luck and happy investing`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i think eth will outperform all crypto bluechips for this coming decade 

 btc obviously did it last decade`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`there 's a ton of institutional interest and many predictions for btc , eth , and crypto seem to think we 've still got some room to run .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`imo , eth is the most promising b / c everything is happening there 

 but , you ca n't go wrong with btc , since it has the name recognition 

 some ppl will shill you garbage coins they want to see pump , but i 'd suggest you really look at a coin and see what 's happening on it ... not what * could * happen on it 

 good luck !`

Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`we were waiting on   btc 's pump to end and trend sideways so the rest of the market could   take a turn . since then , eth has pretty much 2x while btc trended   sideways ( up about 10 % ) .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`once / if we hit price discovery , i think eth could suck up a little   more market dominance and possibly range in the low 20 % for a while .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`buy eth and what lives on it 

 you 're welcome`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`let 's dip 20% ... back down to the price of eth a week ago`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`i saw some d00d cashed out his $ torn for something like 27 eth .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`seems like so long ago eth was sub $ 1k 

 checking charts ... 

 you have to go all the way back to ... jan 11th ... exactly one month ago 

 we all know one month in crypto is like a year anywhere else`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`feels like eth is about to pop off one of those 30 % pumps ... 1800 can only hold for so long in this type of market .`
Buying100K,favor,Ethereum,`lol , i got mocked for buying $ 120 eth ... 

 my buds at work now look the other way when i smile . :)`

PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Crazy if you told me a week ago that BTC dips past 50k and ETH stayed above 2k I wo n’t have believed you lol`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`This season be making ETH look like a pump and dump`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Rip I do n’t know why people will sell ETH under 5k`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`ETH deserves some credit too , it has been undervalued for a while .`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`I think a price ratio does not mean much when eth can do so much more than btc`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`New ATH baby let ’s go ETH`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`A few liquidated ETH longs lol what leverage were they at ?`

PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s have an ETH party ! !`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone remembered what happens when ETH hit an ATH the last time ?`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`What an insane day lol never thought we will see 3.15k eth so soon`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s an ecosystem essentially , what ’s exciting is not ETH itself but the things that can be built on ETH :)`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s an abandoned part of ETH , the majority is on ETH , so the price movements it is experiencing is mainly due to pump and dumps`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just said it ’s not done yet`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just does better everytime someone wants it to fail`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is so steady it ’s bullish , none of that 15 mins pump and dump`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`I hope MOON / ETH ratio will remain the same as before`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`It usually goes up with ETH so I think it could be a long term investment too`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Doge recently pop out , ETH has been leading this run`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Both , ETH with her inevitable correction and DOGE doing whatever it ’s doing`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`I think we will have more correction as ETH is still at 3.3k but we ’ll see .`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`ETH can do smart contracts , BTC ca n’t`

PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`ETH finally getting the recognition she deserves`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Most bull runs end with a BTC ATH , ETH ATH and also at the end of alt season , so we already tick 2 out of 3 boxes ...`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Fact : ETH does not care , when it ’s ATH time , it ’s ATH time 😎`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Really really strong momentum for ETH , curious to see what the ATH will be at the end of day`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`If there was a coin I ’ll be comfortable hodling through bear market , it ’s got ta be ETH ! !`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Lmao it ’s so iconic that ETH is going for an ATH right after the market dipping`

PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`I look at ETH to see how the market is performing now and it ’s lookin pretty bullish !`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s forget about DOGE and root for ETH ! !`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`You know what happens after every dip for ETH , smells like it ’s ATH time !`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH just a little more 🥰`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`I would keep some ETH :) it ’s the ETH tsunami after all !`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Absolutely bullish how ETH maintains above 3.8k`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`I think tron is just a bad copy of ETH , it does not even have the partnership announcements like back in 2017 anymore .`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`Love that ETH is going absolutely apeshit right now`
PM_ME_PM_ME,favor,Ethereum,`It will come but you never know when , eth might go to 5k before it happens`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`From out here I see : 

 Real competition forming 
 ETH rushing a half baked upgrade to play catch up to pos .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Think about using a Uniswap on ETH but paying fees In the coin you are swapping , not needing to hold more ETH for gas .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`You need ETH to transfer ERC20s .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`They try to make dais value as close to one dollar as possible by locking the equivalent value of eth .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`How does the exchange rate not screw you with low liquidity ? say I send xlm and someone wants eth but the liquidity on the dex is low and the sender ends up getting screwed ?`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Can we really say ETH is undervalued if nobody is driving up the price ?`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m not saying ETH is going away by any means .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I guess having long periods of boring ETH movement gets everyone excited over half a percent .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Another day another ETH about to break out comment .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 Unless ETH can get the gas issue under control early in 2021 instead of when 2.0 is complete or beyond I ca n’t see much reason to moon right now .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH can get through 2021 and still retain its title I think we ’re golden .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Doge pumps lie crazy , NANO finally sold a few coins , and ETH stopped its crab walk .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`ETH Take My Energy works well too .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Man , I do n't even like ETH but I would n't even begin to claim that ETH has no development .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think the flack you are taking is because people ca n't admit ETH has problems .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I honestly do n't think we 'll see ETH ATH until 2.0 is finalized and ETH proves that it can retain its network effect in light of increased competition this year .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Wo n't you lose money on the electric making a standard PC mine ETH ( assuming you can even compete ) .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s amazing how many upvotes lazy “ give eth my energy ” posts can net .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH being shit does n’t make NANO more valuable .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`It does n't matter how expensive BTC or ETH transactions are because BTC and ETH do n't aim to do what NANO is trying to .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 I personally think the cap has been bolstered by the failures of ETH of late and the long road for ETH2 

 I m really looking forward to the second half of this year .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`\*some of\ * 

 I highly doubt ETH is going to be the one and only crypto network handling finance .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 They informed me that due to ETH congestion it “ may take weeks ” to finalize the claim .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Point was defi is n’t ETH only .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s only fair in my opinion if they have to listen to : 

 “ Today ETH ATH ” 

 “ Eth take my energy ” 

 But you get my uptoot in general .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`There 's a good number of ETH Moon Bois in here that would say its going to 100k because it " deserves it " .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`You all have ETH to thank for this .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Technically its an Ethereum wallet , so maybe Reddit could say it 's up to the Ethereum Foundation to do the KYC , which would be a dead end .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`It almost made it sound like ETH is just going to leverage Reddit ’s techs to help in scaling .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Glad to see ETH going up but I have the opposite take .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Too many around here think ETH is going to run the worlds financial system alone   for the next 500 years .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`We get it , you want people to buy ETH .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`We do NOT want ADA doing what ETH is doing .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 That said I ’m not a believer in eth replacement , but eth is certainly going to lose market share .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 After this much time though it ’s clear the community favors ETH so it probably is time for ETC to die .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 I sure as hell do n’t expect ETH to moon in a 1 - 2 year timeframe in the state it ’s in .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`BTC ETH etc . around here you ’re just going to get shilled peoples bags ( i.e. they will just suggest a project so you help pump its price ) .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I specifically said ETH wo n't be exclusive , not that ETH is going to be replaced .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I will honestly be completely shocked if 5 years from now ETH is the only chain running dapps and defi .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Do you think ETH just popped out of the ground and suddenly got customers ?`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Honestly seeing ADA , DOT , and BNB hit the top 10 does not make me bullish on ETH .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`That is a lot of market cap that likely could have been going to ETH had it not been going through puberty right now .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine how good ETH would be doing right now had it been functional .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m more impressed that ETH holders still believe ETHs first mover means it ’ll be the one and only chain while 3 competing projects blew into top 5`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`There ’s probably some salt from the years of ETH holders badmouthing competitors for still being in development with no solid release date while v2.0 is .... still in development .. with no solid release date .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I keep saying ETH is going through puberty .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 That said ETH is nt going anywhere .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Did n’t I say ETH will be fine ?`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Nobody said ETH 1.0 is vaporware .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 Please tell me what the difference is between : 

 Cardano will do X when Y feature releases on Z date and ETH 2.0 will do X when Y feature releases on Z date .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I did google it and it fits ETH 2.0 exactly as you would argue it does to ADA 
 2 .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`The ADA boys really do n’t care how the ETH price does .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I think the 1 - 2 years for ETH 2.0 is more than enough time to see if ADA can make it , especially with contracts just weeks away .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 is coming and its coming fast , it will convert the whole network to PoS by next year and fees will be solved .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`No doubt ETH will do well , but that ’s exactly what was said last month at 2k .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH did n’t hit puberty I ’m sure it would have nailed at least 3k by this point .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`ETH holders argue ADA will never succeed because of ETHs first mover advantage .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Some guy just responded to me that that ’s why eth will hit 3k in April .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`My opinion be counter to this is that as more eth like networks come online with dexes centralized exchanges are going to lose a ton of business .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I do n’t disagree that ETH is likely to not sub back to 1500 USD .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s likely less about eth and more dot pump chasers adjusting .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`ETH maxis think their coin will rule them all forever .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Did you all know that ETH is over 2100 ! ?`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Just praise ETH regardless of how its doing .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`It 's the only coin that can get away with simply saying " ETH " or posting rocket emojis .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Cardano does n’t need to come close to flipping ETH to be a success .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`So you ’re literally saying that ETH will be the only smart contract platform and the gargantuan support Cardano received to get that high of a cap without being complete is purely retail idiots who have no idea how the tech works .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Positive eth movement is likely bad for bnb which is only this high due to eths shortcomings .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`I was agreeing that eth is the likely best out of the 3 for short term .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`You ’d have made more on investing in doge at the time eth was 400 .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum decided to remove the hack 's transactions from the ledger to the dismay of purists who believe the ledger should never be manipulated .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`

 Purists argue that blockchain should never be manipulated and thus ETC continues on even though the majority of the crypto world sided with ETH .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`It 's what makes ETH be useful .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Guess eth does still follow btc .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Besides this sub generally being the ETH sub , I think it 's pretty fair .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Honestly , I find ETH is the only one that can get away with completely asinine comments .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`Even robinhood did n’t realize it was n’t eth .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`You realize ETH 2.0 is a phased release and wo n't be finished for well over a year plus ? ; and that 's assuming that it even works and does n't hit any delays .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`The ETC spike is likely unwitting retail from Robinhood thinking it 's Ethereum .`
FidgetyRat,favor,Ethereum,`90 % of the moons came from just posting " ETH " .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Might be last chance to get sub $ 500 ETH for awhile .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`So , that Kraken email I got I should avoid staking my 0.32 ETH with them ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`In Jan I made a bet with my buddy for 1 ETH that ETH would hit $ 700 before end of 2020 ...`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is like byeeeeeee shit coins , I 'm going to the moon with BTC !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`So , I just let my ETH sit in my wallet ...`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Europe did it 's job on ETH ...`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Is the total txn cost determined by # of ETH being transferred of is by txn regardless of amount ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I think eth trader trying to introduce donuts or something as well but they do n't use the reddit vault`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Alright ETH let 's hit $ 800 just for good measure before we ring in the new year in this God forsaken year !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I love the idea of using a decentralized option but the problem is ETH lending only offers 0.17 % on Aave .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Just lump sum buy 7 eth to kick off 2021 , you 're so close to the magic 32 !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Would you consider it safe to use for larger stacks of crypto : eg : 1 BTC , 3 ETH etc ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I added a bit of ETH to try it out do you think it 's still worth taking interest in CEL or it 's too late now ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah , I 'm not moving ETH for awhile .... 431 gwei ( $ 10 ) avg right now 😂`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Can someone please stop me from FOMOing into ETH ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Well at least gas has come back down to a reasonable price , get your txns done now before ETH goes on it 's next run !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think ETH hit $ 1 K on any big exchange yet`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Almost everything I use these days seems to use ETH is some way .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`This is why alts are so damn addicting , I usually only ever play ETH and BTC otherwise .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Here we go again , ETH is running ! 🚀`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Ok ETH just go to ATH now , we all know you wanna !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Hey guys , thinking about buying a ledger nano s since my ETH is now actually worth more like a couple hundred $ .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just recharged now it 's gon na go for $ 1400`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`We got a new cycle peak on ETH , ATH run has started ! 🚀`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Knew it , ETH want that ATH baby !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I hold my ETH to sleep every night ❤ ️`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`They buy shit coins , lose money , go away depressed for a few months , return to learn they should buy btc and eth ...`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`You got 9 ETH then dude ...`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is kinda like an investment in AWS / Azure , almost every other coin pumping right now uses it .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd rather just buy ETH , they all use that anyways so it 's kinda like an investment in all them .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I just hope after this doge and XRP pumps settle down the money will spillover into ETH and other proper crypto once people come to their senses ...`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`That 's my hope as well that at least a percentage of these people come to their senses eventually and end up spilling over into ETH or other sensible crypto .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Just hope that at least a percentage of these people come to their senses eventually and end up spilling over into ETH or other sensible crypto .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Welcome to ATH again my friend ETH , I see you brought your not so cheery friend 350 gwei / gas with you !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Hope you own some ETH or BTC as well .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I would definitely add some ETH , all of defi is pretty much built on it other dapps .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think it 's worth it personally , better to buy another $ 100 worth of ETH at this point vs a ledger later once your stack is bigger .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`But do n't get me wrong in still jumping up and down on the couch for ETH hitting $ 1600 !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I think I went grt -&gt ; 1inch -&gt ; eth`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Considering the current state of gas fees I do n't think I 'll be moving any ETH or tokens anytime soon 😅`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`What about when ETH 2.0 and PoS becomes mainnet ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Amazing thing is ETH is still hitting ATHs even while the BNB competitor is growing !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I think my 0.0004 ETH trade broke Binance , sorry guys .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Beacon eth , it 's what you get for staking ETH on binance`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I really hope this push through , this is very important for ETH .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Miners need to stop their greed before they let it ruin ETH !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I own 99 % ETH , I wonder if I should deversify ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Important that ETH holds $ 1802 here to ensure this does n't turn into a full out correction .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`This is very different than for example giving your ETH to Binance or Kraken and then having them stake for you , or even any pool .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n't sleep because I keep watching ETH charts 👀`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Guys , I think I may be in love with ETH .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`From the past couple years of using Brave I continuously converted my BAT to ETH as soon as uphold withdrawal became available .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I warned about 0.46 ETH in total so far which is now worth $ 800 + .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Let me tell you about Ethereum ...`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Make my ETH evn more valuable , that 's all I care about .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Like I said , buy ETH under $ 1600 no matter what !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm unsure now if it 's the coinbase ipo or Berlin upgrade making ETH go parabolic but either way I love it .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I guess it raises alot of awareness for ETH now , it 's not only the BTC show anymore for the general public !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`3,819,746 or $ 9B worth or 3.3 % of all ETH is now staked on ETH 2.0 nodes , that 's incredible .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think we reach that level until $ 5,000 ETH`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH like fuck that I 'm going straight for $ 2500 !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I think I need more ETH .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`This week ETH has made it 's highest weekly jump in history , + $ 600 .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Get some ETH in there brother !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`You 're watching ETH do it live right now !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is like grandpa BTC let me show you how it 's done 😎`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has made mine blow it 's top already .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Where 's the guy who was trying to tell me ETH is n't in price discovery mode because it was $ 60 from ATH ? 😂`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine Elon come out on SNL and say surprise , ETH is what I 've been buying all along !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`But I mean are you saying your ETH stack grew by 1 ETH of profit   and then you used fiat to buy another ETH ?`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Well done , throw that in ETH and let 's go to $ 5 K !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Wow , ETH wants that $ 4,000 bad .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`and there goes ETH , I fucking love today .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Throw it in ETH now , let it ride to $ 5 K :)`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Okay , doge money flow into ETH please and let 's take it to $ 4,000 !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm seeing the doge money flow to ETH too , -35 % doge , +12 % eth`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has me feeling great !`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I hope you own eth`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is closer to $ 5,000 than previous bull run ATH , that is incredible .`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`Then put your ETH in cefi or stake and let it earn another 5 - 6 % :)`
PunPryde,favor,Ethereum,`I hope you own ETH`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`BTW I own both , I just think ETH will keep the advantage`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Yes , I believe you can swap them for ETH on Uniswap .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Well you can also argue that ETH has an enormous head start since : 

 1- the enormous number of projects that already run on ETH 

`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`It ’s a huge ecosystem already 

 That being said , I hold both ETH and DOT because I like the projects`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`
 Only required thing is you have to obtain some rinkeby testnet ETH for making transaction . ”`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Maybe they meant them buying the Ethereum`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I guess you have n’t read about DeFi or DEX running on Ethereum ?`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`BTC : 439 % increase since 1 year ago 

 ETH : 548 % increase since 1 year ago 


 Who is outperforming who ?`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Optimism should help alleviate network burden : 

 “ Optimism is an L2 scaling solution , which allows for the Ethereum mainnet to be ' unburdened ' from the great number of transactions it has to process .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I really hope they succeed because I think that ETH could use a little competition .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I do n’t think they are actually going to buy the coin but its more likely that they ’re developing a blockchain based on ETH or XRP .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`It ’s a good project , but people should n’t assume that every dApp will jump from ETH to ADA as soon as smart contracts become available on ADA ( whenever that is )`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`EIP-1559 will make Ethereum a deflationary asset ( more Ethereum being burned than is created )`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`The average price of just sending [ ETH is $ 5.60](https://ethgasstation.info / calculatorTxV.php ) ( fastest transaction , 0.003003 ETH )`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`They realized that they can still sell their graphic cards before ETH 2.0 kicks in which will be soon ™`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Long term holds besides ETH and BTC : 

 VET 
 LTO 
 NEO 
 UNI 

 Because I believed these projects have actual uses already .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`“ Ethereum 2.0 is an upcoming set of upgrades to Ethereum that ’s intended to make it significantly faster , less expensive , and more scalable .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Staked ETH ( and rewards ) ca n’t be unstaked until Ethereum 2.0 fully launches , which most experts estimate will happen between 2022 and 2024 .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Please note : the price chart for ETH2 is simply a copy of the ETH price chart . ”`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Also interesting to see BTC jump while the news was about Visa wanting to settle USDC transactions on Ethereum .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I just noticed that by staking Switcheo ( SWTH ) on Demex you earn not only SWTH , but also USDC , BUSD , ETH , and wrapped BTC 

 Everything at the same time ! !`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`So we ’re not allowed to get excited that a major company is experimenting with Ethereum ?`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`So what you ’re saying is that you are salty because Visa is n’t supporting one of the coins you ’ve mentioned you ’re heavily invested in and instead invested in ETH ?`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Same as Demex ; runs on ETH , NEO , and BSC 

 Very interesting concept and you can already start trading by just logging in with a Ledger Nano .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`ADA does n’t even have smart contracts ( yet ! ) 

 Do n’t get me wrong , if ETH was to be overtaken it would have happened already .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`In addition to that it also burns ( deletes ) some of that gas to oblivion as a measure to make Ethereum more scarce : slightly more ETH will be burned than is created , thus making ETH a deflationary asset`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`EIP-1559 makes ETH scarce`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`ETH devs have no influence on gas prices and they are working on lowering them : ETH 2.0 , Sharding , L2 solutions 

 Gas prices are determined by network activity .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`OP I have another one for you : 

 Stake SWTH on Demex ( you can use a ledger nano ) 

 You ’ll get ~40 % APR in SWTH in return as well as payouts in BNB / USDC / ETH / BTC and more based on what ’s traded on that platform`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I shit you not I will buy so much ETH if it ever drops 50 % or more`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Can you make this bet permanent on the ETH blockchain ?`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`The majority of people do n’t even know Ethereum exist`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Yup : 

  Consider the Ethereum blockchain a very busy highway leading from point A to B. Matic / Polygon allows cars to go from A to B by taking an alternative route parallel to ETH .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`

 You can consider Matic / Polygon a side - blockchain of Ethereum`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`ETH will broaden the lanes eventually , but at that time it could be that the traffic also has increased a lot .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`So it could very well be that Matic / Polygon and similar solutions are always required since they exponentially increase the network capacity of Ethereum`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`No , but you can get it on the xDai test net early by first swapping your USD for ETH , ETH for DAI , DAI for xDAI , and then xDAI for shitcoin69420 

 1000000000000x ROI guaranteed`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Let us accumulate ETH silently ;)`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`If they are willing to help you out you should explain them the following : 

 1 : the moons are on the rinkeby Ethereum test net 

 2 : the token ID / adress is : 0xdf82c9014f127243ce1305dfe54151647d74b27a 

 ( Token precision is 18 ) 


 3 : they should be able to get some rinkeby Ethereum via faucet https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ to facilitate the transaction back to your Reddit account 

 Hope this helps !`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`By the time they ’ve decided what ETH is , we ’ve already developed an entire galactic economy`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Just a heads up : Moons moving to main net would mean you have to pay actual Ethereum to move them .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I think everyone needs to think for themselves if a certain crypto is : 

 1 ) worth holding a few years ( BTC and ETH for example ) 

 2 ) could be profitable short term ( days to months )`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I watched ETH go down to $ 80`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`He is talking about selling actual stock and putting it in BTC / ETH ...`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`

 That ’s what I did in 2017 and my ETH stack is now at least 400 % worth more .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`ETH pumping is a reason to believe we ’re not in a bear market ;)`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`If it happens I ’m ready to catch some cheap ETH with fiat`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I just came back from 4h cycling only to notice that ETH has increased by $ 150 🤩`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`This would probably apply to Ethereum : it will probably never be understood by the majority of people , but may be used by people without them actually noticing it ( in the far future )`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`The average Joe ca n’t invest a lot and will never be able to use BTC as fees are astronomical ( average fee is $ 45 right now ) 

 There are more average joes that institutional investors 

 That , and Ethereum is more than a simple payment network .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I ’ve heard Ethereum is the Ethereum killer 🤔`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`This is how the majority of dApps will work on Ethereum .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Yeah it is a possibility , but no way to be certain because ETH would need to break 8k while BTC has to remain at current price 

 Personally I think it will happen , but within years`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`“ Flashbots channels allows users to send their Ethereum transactions directly to miners .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Ditto , you ’re better off buying BTC or ETH if it ’s about the gains .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`July 17 marks the EIP-1559 update which will make Ethereum a deflationary asset 


 Also ; ETH gas fees have been steadily dropping as of late while daily transactions keep increasing 

 As of now transactions are relatively expensive ( $ 1.7 ) , but still 15x lower compared to Bitcoin`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`

 However , a new update which is scheduled for July will put a hard cap on Ethereum and actually make it deflationary`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`VET is solid , I ’d also definitely choose BTC or ETH if you have n’t already`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`ETH2 will get the normal ETH ticker 

 ELI5 : 1 ETH = 1 ETH`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`That ’s $ 10.472.000.000 in ETH staked at current price !`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Friendship with Bitcoin ended , now Ethereum is my best friend`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`They want people to dump their money into a worthless crypto so they themselves can buy BTC and ETH on the cheap`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`It means the ETH 2.0 network will be very secure once it launches`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I really want to stake , but I ’m not sure whether is should trust exchanges with my ETH ..`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`No , ETH 2.0 is “ merely ” moving Ethereum to PoS. Any updates prior to 2.0 will remain as is`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`If ETH ever touches 400 USD or lower .... that would make me ... wet`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I ’d actually consider buying 32 ETH and set up a node for staking ...`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`But I could see it happen when ETH gas costs are consistently low`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`I believe ETH will hit 10 K someday , therefore 3 K seems like a steal ! 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 Obvious not financial advice lmao`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Amazing to see how much Ethereum has grown .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Once Ethereum moves to PoS and Bitcoin still refusing to become more environmentally friendly I can definitely see this happening .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`World of Warcraft was the seed that created Ethereum 

 Change my mind`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Crazy to thing ETH was $ 2900 21 hours ago ... it ’s currently trading at $ 3250`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`ETH seems to have decoupled from bitcoin , and DOGE has decoupled from reality 

 What a wild ride this is !`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`The same WSB that allowed crypto talk ( BTC and ETH ) for 1 day and banned it afterwards because of a news article criticizing WSB for allowing crypto talk ?`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`( I ’d estimate end of may , beginning of June ) 

 https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/ 


 Since around 30 % of Ethereum fees is produced by Uniswap , I ’d guess after Optimism we will see a sharp decline in Ethereum transaction fees`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`It can flip BNB but flipping ETH would require DOGE to be $ 3`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Interesting to see that everyone mentioning Ethereum is getting downvoted .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`Compare how active development on the Ethereum blockchain is and how it ’s currently adopted globally and then decide who has a brighter future ; ETH or ONE 

 That does n’t mean you should go all in on one of them though .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`It ’s what makes Ethereum better .`
Dwaas_Bjaas,neither,Ethereum,`

 Consider Matic the “ Cosmos ” of Ethereum`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I honestly think ETH is still massively undervalued for what it is`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`And then I figure I could do that , or I could buy more ETH .`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Really hope the people that made money off of Doge reinvest it into actually good projects like VET or ETH`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I literally ca n't praise VET enough , it might be my favorite coin ever next to ETH`

ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`All of those are good choices , with ETH and VET being the best imo`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`ETH , VET , LTO , LINK , XLM have the best real life use cases imo 

 CHZ could also be there in a few years if it manages to get more sports partnerships`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd DCA , you could buy 500 $ of ETH for example and then another 500 $ in a week or so .`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`The whole market except for ETH seems to be mirroring what BTC does , when projects should be judged on their own merit`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`The kids would n't be shitcoins , ETH genes too strong`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Huge day for ETH so feeling great !`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`A really great day for ETH , so excited to see where it goes from here !`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`ETH and BTC are the safest bets , I like VET and LINK too , I think they 'll be even bigger in the future`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I just think it 's ETH going to where it belongs , which is much higher`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is making dreams come true`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd keep some BTC too but I also think ETH is the future of crypto`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`NANO is The Flash because speed 

 ETH is Thanos because it 's inevitable 

 DOGE is Deadpool because it should really be dead but it just ca n't be killed`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Oh it definitely is fine , I just think there 's gon na be coins like ETH that will do much better than BTC`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Do n't let ETH at 2700 $ distract you from an important fact .`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`And the crazy thing is that ETH is still ridiculously undervalued`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`If we 're hitting these numbers now , just imagine what will happen when ETH 2.0 comes out .`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`It 's not silly at all , the best choices right now are ETH and VET imo`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`It still exists , it 's called ETH 2.0`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure I agree that BTC is a shitcoin but ETH is definitely the future`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Can whatever happened to ETH happen to LTO now ?`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`It 's ok , I 'd get some more ETH though`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't know , ETH is too good to be true but it 's not a scam`

ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`The coin I 'm most bullish on by far , except for ETH`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`ETH will definitely surpass BTC at some point , it 's inevitable`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`The 2 are not exclusive , BTC will definitely hit way over 100 K , ETH will still surpass it though`

ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`When ETH breaks 3 K it 's off to the races , everything will pump to the moon`

ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Europe ai n't sleeping , how am I supposed to sleep with ETH at these prices ? !`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Well it 's 4 am here , but I just had to see ETH hit 3K. Good night , watch the charts for me people !`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think I 'll be surprised by any ETH ath to be honest , it 's still criminally undervalued`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I HODL ETH , VET and Moons so I 'm doing amazing !`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`With ETH going like this in no time`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm surprised were not breaking 30 K with ETH doing what it 's doing`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`ETH needs some rest before continuing the pump to 5 K`
ThePhantomDave,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is what every crypto wishes it could be`

ebaley,against,Ethereum,`If it does n't improve why hold Ethereum ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt;Top 15 ( ! ) accounts represent 52 % of total ETH staked .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 " evolving tech " does n't mean ETH deserves special treatment .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`I see no point holding ETH when it still has about the same ratio as 4 years ago .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Showing the price in Bitcoin is a better indicator of how ETH is doing compared to BTC .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`If they are locking up their ETH they are committing to holding it .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`It 's suggesting holding ETH is a big deal .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Perhaps I ’m tired of Ethereum being constantly hyped as an amazing investment and yet underperforming for those 3 - 4 years you mentioned .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Then can we be spared the eth is going to 10k or the flippening comments ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Dude the recent ETH contract had only 14 addresses depositing over 50 % .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`We heard boasts about ETH until cryptokitties crippled it . 

 & gt;I think we have very different opinions of fiat .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`If you 've been doing it for years you 'll see it 's pointless buying both Bitcoin and ETH .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Now I can say ETH is a PoS blockchain .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`:) 

 What about the ETH being mined ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`I think it 's because it 's Ethereum people are getting over - excited .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt;I hate when I see BTC maxis downplaying how Ethereum is changing the internet at its core .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`You do n't know the guys with the girls have 32,000 eth .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`And I question how decentralised ETH is .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`I doubt Ethereum will still be around .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`The voting on ETH 2.0 will make it too centralised .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Since Ethereum is still down 80 % vs Bitcoin and is still barely above its Coinbase listing price from 4 years ago I have to question its reputation as an investment .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Are you saying ETH 2.0 is completely ready or anywhere near it ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 And Ethereum was pre - mined , Bitcoin was n't .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Since 70 million ETH were pre - mined I think that 's far more likely to be considered a ponzi .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Since ETH is a worse store of value , can not scale so has to be replaced with another coin , has been censored ( the Dao rollback ) and is pre - mined it clearly is the shitcoin .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Or if it were a layer 2 network on Bitcoin or even Ethereum I might say it was better .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 What has ETH got ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`ETH still has PoW two years after Buterin said he did n't believe in it .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Because ETH has not proven to be better at keeping value long term as Bitcoin .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`If you look only at the price in USD it looks ETH is doing well .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`So you 're admitting ETH is just trying to cash in on Bitcoin 's success ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt;still advocate crypto currency fundamentals , such as decentralisation 

 Whilst ignoring the fact that it can not be since the entire supply was in the hands of the dev from day one . 

 & gt;they are the antithesis of crypto and in their letter to the SEC actively accused BTC and ETH of being ' Centralised and controlled by the Chinese ' 


 No difference .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Right now BTC is failing ( fees , no development ) , ETH is failing ( fees , lack of development ) , half the rest are scams ( EOS , TRON , others ) , some do n't know what they want to do and try to do everything ( XLM , CA , IOTA ) with the result that nothing gets done at all .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Since ETHBTC is still down about 77 % you losing out on gains by holding ETH instead of Bitcoin .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Ethereum will become Bitcoins L2 .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`It started when a BTC maxi of all people found there was no easy way to verify the ETH supply .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; it ’s still centralized 

 So is ETH .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`They would say ETH is the shitcoin for not respecting the Dao smart contract .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`However it 's Ethereum that 's the shitcoin , as a money certainly .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`In fact ETH miners do n't want PoS. 

 And PoS is just that - a piece of shit .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Well done to ETH for breaking its dollar ATH but the reality is it keeps value less well against Bitcoin .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`They think Doge is like Ethereum ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Are you honestly suggesting bitcoin is allowed to get put " back on course " and ether is not ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Ethereum classic is known as a ' fork ' , meaning basically , a team of developers made a copy of the ethereum code and blockchain and started running it as their own blockchain , calling it Ethereum Classic .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt;Now it 's in ETH and dear lord I feel safer .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`/s 

 Doge got closer to returning to its sats ATH than ETH did .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Yes , but say Ethereum should get a pass either ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 And eth heads laughed at Bitcoin 's fees and now look where we are .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt;There is a reason why Ethereum is migrating to PoS 

 You really think they are doing that just because of the environment ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Even if I ignore the exchanges and the IRS , you pay a hefty fee in holding Nano against the likes of Bitcoin or Ethereum .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Because AWS can do what ETH can do for vastly cheaper ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Ethereum is decentralized .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; I see ETH as a very undervalued project 

 Considering it has to replaced by another coin because it can not scale I think its highly overvalued .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Ethereum certainly should n't be the price it is considering it has to be replaced .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; not even ether 

 What makes you think that 's special ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`A very controversial decision considering there was nothing wrong with Ethereum itself and the idea of not respecting the smart contract made nonsense of the whole idea of them being autonomous .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; ETH I believe will be the " new " crypto reserve currency 

 Lol .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`I 've opened my mind and seen that ETH is pre - mined , has a chaotic monetary policy , not truly censorship resistance , centralized and a platform for money making rackets .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Some say Ethereum is a shitcoin ( pre - mined , centralized around VB , prone to censorship , mutable monetary policy ) .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`You think Ethereum is truly decentralized ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`The ETH crowd like to claim Bitcoin is “ outdated tech ” to push their agenda .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 What is ETH ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`We consider ETH to be a shitcoin .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`I do n't see how this " pumping " is any different from what ETH is doing , except DOGE 's rise is more impressive .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`You mean as usual its followers are going to ensure ETH takes the credit for a bull run Bitcoin started .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`You can just tack on store of value . 

 & gt;People buy bitcoin because they expect the price to go up , what happens when Ethereum can serve the same purpose but also more ? 

 Because it suffers a lot more in a bear market ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum is so good a scam many do n't see it for what it is .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`You do n't think there 's a promise that can transmute a PoW coin into a PoS one do you ? 

 & gt;What do big holders gain from ETH 2.0 ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`They are other coins which are not backward compatible with Bitcoin . 

 & gt;What does ETH 2.0 offer to benefit early adopters , aside from what it does now ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Smart contract interactions are directly settled on the main chain , 

 Lightning is possible thanks to smart contracts so how is that any different ? 

 That website link clearly showed more value is sent using Bitcoin than Ether .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 There ca n't be that much more sent without using ether .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`It was n't Ethereum directly which made what happened next worse . 

 & gt;(one Google search away ) 

 It should be easy for Ethereum to tell us that .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; So , only time will tell if Ethereum can overtake Bitcoin as a store of value .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`What good is ETH if the foundation is rotten ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Why did n't he build ETH on top of Bitcoin if he 's a genius and does n't care about money ? 

 As for being VB being a young genius , Einstein was 26 when he published 4 papers , including Special Relativity .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`A lot of what Ethereum claims to do for example .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`Perhaps that 's why ETH is pumping more than Bitcoin ?`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`You 'll know ETH is not decentralized nor is it censorship resistant .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Not in relation to Doge . 

 & gt;When ETH starts declining but DOGE and other shitcoins still keep going up , then you know things are going to go bad .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 Not to bail out a select few because of a problem that was n't even in Ethereum .`
ebaley,against,Ethereum,`

 ETC is driven by ETH users who did n't approve of censoring the blockchain to bail out a select few .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`  The more popular eth becomes the more tokens are taken out of circulation which in turn make the ones still in circulation ever more valuable .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`I got into eth recently myself , been buying using Gemini .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`As demand for nfts dis finance and other   eth blockchain applications proliferate and become mainstream , chance is we will only ever have periods of high deflation and medium to low deflation depending on the overall real world economy .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`As eth use cases and applications grow exponentially , so will the number of tokens   taken out of circulation vs new ones minted .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`By making each transaction less expensive , you open up possibilities for many more eth powered markets and applications .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`And yes I 'm aware there are a lot more eth tokens than btc in circulation but eth is also much more useful for real world applications .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`That is I why can see each eth token worth as much as btc one day , meaning total " market cap " of eth will be many times greater than btc .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`At least ether ownership is n't a zero sum game and ever soaring   price does n't preclude others from using it , unlike housing stocks .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;Fees will get burned instead of going to the miners ( ETH becomes a store of value ) 

 Ib4 btc maximalists angrily proclaim that only btc is allowed to be a store of value just because .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Afterward you should be able to fund a   comfortable lifestyle complete with plenty of jet setting travels with your eth holding alone , and still see the value of your holding continues to steadily appreciate .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 Of course there is always a chance that eth fails to scale and ca n't adequately solve the state growth problem , and is replaced by one of the many " eth killers " in waiting .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;Last year , an analysis of network transactions showed that EIP 1559 would have burned nearly 1 million Ether in 365 days .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Now imagine what will happen when eth transactions volume go up by 1000 times which it is bound to happen in the coming years .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;According to a source i found online , it stated that " Last year , an analysis of network transactions showed that EIP 1559 would have burned nearly 1 million Ether in 365 days .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`With how much ether will be worth then , taking out $ 50 K a year for personal consumption wo n't make a dent to you crypto nest eggs and your tokens will appreciate much more quickly than you can spend at that rate .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`I think this will do more to scale eth and solve the state growth problem than any particular rollup .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`I think this will do more to scale eth and solve the state growth problem than any particular rollup , by enabling sharding and related dev options .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`In fact it is truly remarkable and testimony to the exploding popularity of defi that ether tokens outperformed btc last year despite the lack of supply halving .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`And by wisely I mean put it all in eth tokens !`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;when ETH moves to PoS it 's going to be taken over by Mark Cuban and his buddies 

 What do you mean`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;putting your eth into defi protocols or exchanges comes with the risk of it being hacked or smart contracts being compromised 

 Would decentralized staking like rocketpool be more secure ?`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`By then eth price will be a lot higher which makes staking more worthwhile as well .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`By going all in eth with my crypto holding I 'm already take a risk so I do n't feel like taking on additional risk by staking right now .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`By then apr will be lower ( but not lower than 5 % ? ) but   ether price will be much higher which more than make up for that .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`They gon na need all the trillions in their ether profits to fund all the Herculean infrastructure projects to combat rising sea levels over the next couple decades .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;the total supply of Ether would slowly decrease over time rather than slowly increasing 

 Yes .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`All these factors , along with exponentially increasing demand from ever expanding use cases , will make ether tokens the most valuable commodity in cyberspace .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 Specifically to eth , regardless of what happens to its token price in 6 weeks or 6 months , so long as the scaling solutions , eth2 , pos and 1559 get implemented successfully , we will see its value X100 in less than two decades .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`But it is far more likely that eth will have taken off and become a cornerstone of finance .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`By then staking will be widespread and many big financial institutions will be ether whales who will probably be active as validators as well .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Granted with ether still appreciating that 3 % is compounding off ever growing principal which is still better than s&amp;p , certainly much better than bond and cd yields which are what we should really be comparing to .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`It may become an ( expensive ) obsession of sort for many would be hackers out there , especially as ether use cases   continues to grow exponentially and   attracts more attention .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`And eventually may go up from there as ether tokens in circulation shrink ?`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 In contrast , with ether and staking not only do you accumulate capital appreciation but said appreciation further compounds your rewards from staking .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Theoretical cs is actually super useful for gaining deeper understanding of blockchain and eth in particular .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Few people will be selling because eth holders are making money from staking and defi ( unlike btc hodl ) .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`What do you see in btc that eth ca n't do better ?`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`You should be able to easily fund those with a portion of your monthly staking rewards , as eth continues to appreciate in value aka making real world purchases increasingly more deflationary for you .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 You do n't pay tax for taking out loan against your eth holding because that is not income`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 Note that ether token price is n't in this equation .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`The point is the cost of doing transactions on the ethereum blockchain is determined by demand vs availability of block space , not ether market price .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 I guess it is possible that if ether token price goes up massively over very short period of time eg you wake up tomorrow to find that ether is now trading at $ 200k a piece , then it would disrupt the functioning ecosystem .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`The fact that eth ecosystem is well established and enormous makes it the place to be for all serious dapp developers .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;Due to the size , momentum , and existing adoption of the network , you know that Ethereum will be around essentially forever and that the NFTs backing your digital assets will be in existence .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`ETH is for supporting that money , in all its ways .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;simply exchange ETH for rETH ( staked ETH on Rocketpool ) and store that in your hardware wallet 

 Do you think rpl will appreciate more than ether over time ?`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Acquire 10 tokens and hodl for 5 years , then eth forever and comfortably off passive income from staking .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`

 Remember that Ether tokens are the keys that grant access privilege to the ethereum network .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`

 I have been saying that eth at the current price is akin to coastal ca housing price back in the 1950s .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Pos has no bearing on this scenario 

 & gt;Although Ethereum has a native token ( ETH ) , much of the value on the system is   not   in ETH : It 's in other tokens on the network , or other data and applications .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Generally it 's assumed that as these become popular ETH will also go up , but in theory it 's possible that in future , even though the Ethereum network is very useful and manages very valuable assets , the actual value of the token will be much smaller .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`That and also wall st behemoths will need ether tokens to get income from staking and myriads of defi applications .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`As visa MasterCard are on onboard using eth to settle their trillions of dollars of transactions just like shown in one of its diagrams`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`ETH 


 I guess that is one way to put it .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Ether tokens are not really analogous to shares in a corporation though , which is also why the concept of market cap does n't apply to crypto .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`In so far as the finance industry is moving toward eth and tokenization , wall st institutions will hoard ether tokens to make sure they always have the fastest lanes open for their products and transactions .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 The people paying for taxis with their ether tokens will regret even more than the people who used their Btc to buy pizzas .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Eg say you own 11 ether tokens and the price has risen to $ 70000 , which is a very realistic scenario for 2025 after eth2 pos merge and widespread decentralized staking .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;Here ’s to 100k in 2030 

 If you follow everything that is going on with eth and defi , and the debasement of fiat currencies ,   you 'd know that we will be at 100k a lot sooner than that .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`As that bull case for ethereum put it , having some btc is useful as a hedge if the eth rocket malfunctions at launch .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 Personally I think staking or even defi is probably not worth it right now at current ether price level unless you own a lot of tokens .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Ether will likely be valued at $ 30k+ the merge is done and decentralized staking commonplace which means that many people can now earn thousands of dollars annualized which makes for a much more interesting proposition .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`It will depend on how quickly ether token circulation shrinks .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 This will cause ether price to continue to soar which in turn amplifies income which then gives investors even more reason to hold and buy more .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`And the feedback loop continues ... 

 This income yielding aspect is what make ether fundamentally different from btc .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`

obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Only unknown unknown is whether ether will be worth $ 100k apiece or $ 300k apiece in 5 years haha`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Posts on this sub from the year 2025 : 

 Is it too late to get ETH since the price is now 300k ? 

 And the answer will still be the same : no . 

 Because there is no limit to how high ether can go as your income from staking / defi scales along token price appreciation so for most people and institutions there is no reason to sell , ever .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 With ether staking when you earn 3 % that is buoyed by a deflationary asset .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`This is why pos is green and makes ether the eco friendly crypto / blockchain`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`& gt;The more ETH you stake , the greater your chances of winning each block .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 Also a decentralized platform like eth allows driver to connect with a much larger body of riders , not just those that signed up specifically to be uber users .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 The downside is that if a particular implementation falls out of favor the corresponding token will become worthless very quickly , even as eth continues to dominate and gain ever more transactions and use cases .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Even more annoying is that posts like this keep getting upvoted , much like all the price discussion / I just bought a whole eth yeah posts .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 Ether oth is backed by real world use cases and becoming more useful by the day 


 When this bubble   bursts only ones flourishing will be ether and eth based level 2 and side chain tokens`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`It is very likely that in a few years ether will be at $ 300k apiece but gas price has become much lower / negligible thanks to all the rollup and level 2 solutions .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`


 As to why ether price is going up .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`This is also why scaling and other solutions that boosts block space are so important , so everyone , not just the whales , can fruitfully use and benefit from the eth network , the backbone of web3.0 .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Ether price will grow exponentially along use cases and transaction volume , the latter is bound to grow by 1000x in the coming years`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Ether transactions work with an auction like system where miners /validators post pos decides which and whose transactions to clear first depending on how much they are paying for the access fee aka ether tokens .`
obsd92107,neither,Ethereum,`Ether tokens in circulation are about to start shrinking , at ever accelerating pace in the coming years`

DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`“ Passed ” Invested in Riot / Mara and Ark ETFs , invested in ADA and ETH ... this is n’t a race .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Anyone downvoting bought ETH at the ATH of 2k ...... in price discovery mode , instead of back at 200 bucks in 2020 .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`All people who bought ETH at 2k after watching a bitboy youtube video .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I have a medium bag staked , but I am on the fence about not grabbing some more ETH before July .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`32 ETH at 7k is life changing gains , at least it would be for me .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 I hold a bunch of ETH and am very excited for July , but do n't think in 5 years ETH will be alone .... paired with all the companies in the world .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Gavin and Charles are both brilliant programmers and mathematicians , they have a unbelievable team working on their projects , and they know the weaknesses of the ETH network .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I   feel that investing in ADA now , is like getting in ETH in 2015 - 2016 .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Do you think ETH will top out at 2k this cycle ?`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`If you think NO project besides dinosaur proof of work bitcoin or ETH has value in this space .... you might want to open a book or do some research .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`How about 3k ADA , 2k DOT ( from back in march ) , a fistful of ETH , XLM , VET , and yea that 's all I see .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Ca n’t argue with that , ETH does make you buy ETH to trade .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`No difference between using your bank account , or an ETH that you convert to cash to pay .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Using ETH or Bitcoin to buy " things " , instead of holding ETH or Bitcoin as a store of value and growing your wealth seems ignorant and self - defeating .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Not sure why you did n't get in at 5 cent ADA , and 200 ETH last year ?`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you for in the top 20 during mid 2020 ( eth , dot , cosmos , ada , hell even xrp , litecoin was 25 bucks .... 

 It is that easy , why complicate things .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`It does n't matter if giant whales are getting involved ... it does n't matter what Marc cuban says to pump the ETH he bought to the moon .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has space to run , and BTC as well . 

 JPMorgan , another dirty mega whale , predicted 130k for BTC , they will make sure it gets there before they pull the rug , or at least close .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Imagine believing that ETH will always remain # 2 ?`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH devs bit off more than they could chew in 2021 , and half of the year uniswap and ETH gas fees / transaction speeds have made it almost unusable .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`He did n’t make a bad decision putting money in ETH before July .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Who knows if ETH will be number 2 in five years .... or the dinosaur proof of work bitcoin wo n’t be replaced by banana coin .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I have a handful of eth and some Crypto I want to give my son when he gets older , just not banking too much on it being forth a fortune .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Let ETH upgrade .... let the coinbase IPO drop , let ADA mainnet go live with smart contracts , let XRP win the lawsuit ..... this year has plenty of supprises left .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I have a bunch of ETH , and trust me , I am rooting for it this run .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Any more billionaire eth shillers they could add to the roster ? 

 Hey we own millions of dollars of this asset , lets tell you how much we like it !`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`We have room , I believe ETH has room , and alts have some blasting off to do .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Dude told me to buy ETH at 300 dollars , I loaded up ..... and happy I did .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`10 years is an ADA , ETH , DOT hold .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Ada mainnet is going live , ETH upgrade , and a path to 100k for bitcoin is in the cycle chart .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Alt season is n’t “ now ” until xrp is breaking the charts and ETH is 3X from here .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`It does n’t have to hit ETH levels , that seems impossible .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Xrp got me into Cyrpto in 2019 , then I loaded up ada , ETH , Dot , cosmos in the crash of 2020 .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`This " could " go 5X. We are mid cycle , after the first MAJOR wave out of three .... the ETH upgrade is in July making ETH a deprecative asset .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Just saying , the ETH market share and the hungry developers from Cardano have other plans .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Personal opinion , but I see ADA , VET , ETH , DOT as nice 5 year holds .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Instead of being late the party with bitcoin in 2021 , or buying 2,500 ETH , you can invest in something before it becomes enormous .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Think of what will challenge ETH and bitcoin and invest in those as well .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Say what you want about bitboy but he got me into ETH at 300 bucks last year .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`What ? 

 XRP and XLM 

 ETH , DOT , ADA 

 BTC LTC 

 VET 

 Your diversified .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`  22 ETH , it pains me to think about how soul crushing this is .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`They are running test net all may and June working out kinks to make sure it does n’t end up like ETH or the mess that is uniswap .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 JpMorgan reps shilling ETH , who would have believed this could happen ........`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I doubt that ETH will be the only successful platform for dapps , dexes , deft , and smart contacts in 2025 .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`ETH used to talk about being the Web 3.0 and how everything will run on ETH , but the reality is Tezos , Algo , Cosmos , DOT , ADA ...... VET , these projects are here to stay .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`It is elegantly complex , and thinks beyond the scope of what ETH intends to become .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Nothing ETH ca n't do that other platforms ca n't .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Love ETH as a store of value though ( for now )`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`The people who remained loyal to ETH are watching the entire world pass them by .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I hold ETH , and want it to succeed .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Meanwhile some wanker in his basement who scraped up his lunch money to buy 1 whole ETH is whining on reddit about it succeeding .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I hold ETH and love it , I just like ADA more .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Watching Phase 2 of the ALT season cycle take over ( ETH being dominant and BTC losing its footing ) make me think that it would be better to allocate your money into tier 3/4 coins in the top 20 .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Some people are selling ETH on the ramp - up to the upgrade instead of after after ... on the ramp up to the cardano ecosystem etc . different strategies but the same cycle ends of occuring`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`  Admittedly , it feels like almost everything is running on ETH ...... for now .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`While we have this run playing out , make sure to hedge   your ETH confidence with other projects that will be here in 5 years .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is a first mover , and first mover 's are at a severe disadvantage in that they set the precedent for what should be improved , what needs tweaking to make a finished product .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`but if you think ETH will be the one and only smart contract king of this space , it is time to take the blinders off .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`In terms of gains : 

 Investing in ETH now with an expectation in Q4 at the end of year that it will be 10k(about a 3x from here ) .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Depending upon when you are getting in this run , investing in ETH or BTC right now might NOT be the way to maximize your gains .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 The biggest news of the year is the ETH upgrade , so all eyes on ETH , right ? 

 Why buy a drop of bitcoin and chase the volatility through Q4 , holding a fraction of a coin through the bear market , when you can maximize your profits with a bag full of a great project that will easily 5X ?`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think it will be " bigger " than ETH .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`ETH network are flying by the seat of their pants , wait until the cardano dex goes live !`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Looking at buffet and listening to his outdated babble ( holding his coca - cola stocks from 1924 ) does n’t convince me that ETH is nt running up until the upgrade ... or bitcoin is n’t going to make some moves .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t get me wrong , I will hold some ETH until Q4 , but I will also take profits on the run up to the upgrade .`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 Q3 : I m happy to exit a bit of ETH and litecoin 
 Absolute Q4 holds : XRP , XLM , ETH 
 Absolute 2025 holds : ADA and some ETH`
DrPechanko,favor,Ethereum,`

 People keep saying the gas fee reduction will be “ part of the ETH upgrade ” .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`There are times when the ledger live app gives me trouble , and I just access my ETH / ERC-20 tokens via MEW .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`The below details were included in the announcement that YFI and Sushi were joining together 

 * Keep3r will move the full treasury as liquidity to Sushiswap KP3R / ETH ( \~$11MM ) 
 * Keep3r will implement on - chain limit orders , stop loss , and take profit for Sushiswap LPs 
 * Keep3r will offer gasless swaps via MetaWallet for Sushiswap trades`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I took some profits to build a gaming desktop , now the video card ( 3080 ) is keeping me warm at night while mining \~$3.70 in ETH every day .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`You can just use kraken to buy monero without kyc if you want , but you ca n’t deposit from a bank account , you have to deposit crypto ( btc , eth , usdc , etc ) and trade for other crypto which you can withdraw .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm going to put some on an exchange and set some stop losses for ETH , I get the feeling we are gon na blow past old ATH and into the 2k range , and do n't want to miss out on those gains .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I ’m fine with missing the opportunity if it does n’t happen though as I ’m holding eth anyway .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Nope , I fully expect eth to take off again someday soon , just expect a possible dip before that .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`ETH is usually the most profitable to mine , I 'm getting maybe 6 - 7 $ a day from a 3080 , you might be able to get $ 9 - 10 on a 3090 .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`BTC is up 360 % in 1 year , which is a good return , ETH is up 750 % though , just saying ...`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Who knows , if alt season actually hits hard at some point ETH and Link both could go surprisingly high ... easy 3 - 4x from current levels if that happens imo .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Hindsight is always 20/20 ... you might be saying you miss the 1k eth 3 months from now .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`So here is a overly simple explanation ... 

 If I add to a ETH - USDT liquidity pool , and Eth doubles in price , then when I withdraw them ... the total value I have would be about 5 % less than what I would have had if I just held that same amount of ETH / USDT .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Can you imagine how much volume some of these ETH projects would have if the fees were reasonable ?`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Binance Smart Chain is really more of a hybrid CEX blockchain , considering the native token is a CEX token , and the majority of its other assets ( USDT , DAI , ETH , BTC ) are simply backed by Binance and not the actual assets .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm not selling unless ETH rockets up to 10k in the next few months , as I think there would be a big correction coming if that happens .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`It depends on the type of transaction , you can send eth for 150 gwei or do a uniswap trade for 150 gwei and price will be extremely different .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Read up on it carefully , all the other places that have offered Eth staking , mean Eth 2.0 staking , and they basically take your eth and give you a token that represents Eth2.0 , which will earn interest .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`

 The problem is eth 2.0 is less valuable because it ca n't be used until 2.0 goes live , it only can earn interest , so you can buy eth2.0 tokens on places like binance and kraken , and likely coinbase in the future , and it costs 5 % less than eth .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Staking your eth like this would cause you to lose 5 % of your investment instantly , so better to just trade your eth for it .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I was talking about the more common investments ... such as btc and eth , meaning they still have a lot of room to grow as crypto normally goes way beyond the previous all time highs , not just a few times past it .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm always suprised when I hear people say this ... going all in on anything that is n't BTC / ETH is about the highest risk investment you can make , and yet plenty feel confident enough to do it .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH \~1 % from ATH prices on a Sunday , that 's not usual , but I 'm fine with every Sunday being just under a new ATH .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Was n’t aware you can swap btc directly from the coinbase wallet , figured that would only be for coins like eth and tokens .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`BNB is still a completely centralized coin , and almost all of the big tokens on BSC are simply Binance pegged exchange tokens ( BTC , ETH , USDT , ADA , etc ... ) , so BSC is far from ideal from a decentralized perspective .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Not sure if it will be today , tomorrow , or Wednesday , but 50k BTC and 2k eth is going to feel good .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`ETH has a limit of how much GAS can fill one block , and unless that changes , TPS is going to stay the same , similar to bitcoins scaling dilemma .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`People should play around with BSC with metamask to get comfortable with DeFi ... if you add to an LP and change your mind on ETH and want to withdraw , you are out hundreds in gas ...`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Well ETH is congested so people can use BSC for now , and all the new development on BSC can easily be transferred to ETH once the fee problem is under control .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`

 Stargate is about to go live on cosmos which will make interchain dexes and other bridges between different blockchains possible ... meaning tokens and swaps can move between cosmos and eth , bsc , and even bitcoin .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`You would get more if you swapped your eth for beth on Binance ... beth is eth 2.0 .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`

 You can get beth by staking your eth but it ’s a better deal to just swap for it as it sells at a discount .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`

 I predict many big ETH Defi projects will release BSC clones in the coming months , to give people low fee alternatives ... the networks are basically the same so its not too much work to launch on BSC .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Fees have been so insane on eth that miners are making a lot of money , and I already have mined around $ 450 worth of ETH ... current rates are over $ 12 a day in ETH ( costs about $ 1 a day in electricity ) .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`BSC is basically swinging a crowbar at the knee of all other smart contract platforms at this point ... you might think its hurting eth , but eth has such a massive network effect that its the other up and coming platforms that are going to take the real damage from the BSC momentum .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I swear , I had like 30 % Eth and 10 % BNB in my portfolio just last week , but now I have more BNB than ETH , strange .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I thought I was going to wake up to 2k eth this morning but instead wake up to $ 330 bnb ... alright then , not complaining .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`

 To give you an example of how profitable it is , an Nvidia RTX 3080 retails for $ 700-$850 , and one of those cards can get 98 MH / S , which would make almost $ 14 a day in ETH at current rates .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Andre Cronje keeps on posting interesting info on his twitter , a few big eth projects ( Sushi , Curve , Yearn ) are going to be bridged over the Fantom network instead of eth L2 to solve the gas issues , and FTM 's value is likely going to explode at some point because of this .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`If you use BTC , ETH , LINK , ADA , etc ... on BSC , you are n't playing with crypto , you are playing with IOU tokens that are simple deposited on Binance .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`

 If you look at the cost of bridging tokens from BSC to ETH , they are identical to the withdraw cost from binance , because that s what you are doing when you withdraw from BSC to eth , you are just withdrawing from Binance 's CEX onto ETH .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`It ca n’t be that easy , it was n’t actually clear to me how I get my ftm from Binance to the actual ftm network as Binance only allowed withdraws to eth .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Some big projects plan on bridging over from ETH to Fantom for some super low cost defi ...`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`This is n’t how 2018 crash started ... btc is still making new highs almost daily , eth being a little slow but still pushing up .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Eth 2.0 is well underway and chains like Ada have huge market caps just by having the potential to do what eth does with low fees , meanwhile eth has the potential to scale in reasonable time frame and is still the place where the whales trust their money and make even more using defi .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`You do n’t understand how much money there is to make on eth for whales .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`It lets me add a segwit address but still says fees will be $ 24 ... binance 's withdraw fees are usually really bad on btc / eth / erc20 coins .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`If you are simply sending eth or a token to another address , you can just set the gas limit to what you want to pay and wait for it to process ( it might not send if you go tooo low ) , this works as long as you know how to increase gas speeds or cancel the transaction later ( metamask is pretty simple for this ) .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`It was obvious 1inch was coming to BSC , they were one of the last tokens listed on Binance 's official ETH to BSC bridge .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Price wise , ETH or BTC would have made you a lot more money as an investment in the past 3 years , and actually are far from dead .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`

 It is most certainly centralized DEFI though , all of the major tokens ( BTC , ETH , ADA , UNI , etc ... ) that are on BSC are simply deposited in Binance exchange , and the tokens on BSC are just IOU 's .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Yes , and other platforms like kraken and Binance allow you to trade eth for already staked eth that will earn interest , so you usually can save a few percent and just buy the staked eth at a small discount rather than staking it 1:1 for your eth ,`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`It ’s not really decentralized though ... consensus is decentralized but the Binance bridge to eth has to go directly through Binance exchange ... 

 Look at the withdrawal fees on the bsc bridge , all those tokens you are trying to withdraw from bsc are just iou ’s that are actually stored on Binance .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I do n't mind , but if you have BTC in your BSC wallet , the real BTC is actually sitting on Binance until you go through the bridge ( BSC tokens like BTC , ETH , LINK , are just IOU 's basically that are sitting deposited into binance )`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`If you look at your wallet in bscscan.com , you 'll see that BTC , ETH , and many big tokens are called Binance - Peg BTC , Binance PEG USDT , etc ... 

 That means those tokens are in reality stored in Binance until you withdraw them from BSC to another network .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`They have a lot invested in equipment and thought they had until eth 2.0 to make profits , but eip 1559 is going to make profits go down well before 2.0 hits .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`You are not factoring in missed opportunity costs by locking all that money up in litecoin for years , bitcoin and eth both has better returns across the board .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Even if a few big projects move to L2 over the next few months , I imagine that alone could ease some of the congestion ETH has been struggling with .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`The fix has nothing to do with the centralization of BSC ... the same exact thing could have happened to a project on ETH .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Cream , originally an eth only project , also got hit by a dns attack today ... to claim this is about centralization is just wrong , it ’s about shitty projects not having great security .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`With eth , you got ta go big or go to BSC , lol 

 Seriously though , I ca n’t justify buying less than a thousand dollars of anything on uniswap , it just feels wrong with the gas fees .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`It ’s honestly not that huge of a decision , Binance and kraken both have trading pairs so you can trade staked eth back to regular eth if you wanted to sell before eth 2.0`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I thought Charles responding to MetaMask on Twitter recently was quite telling ... his response was basically “ Do n’t you know who I am , I founded Ethereum and Cardano” ... meanwhile , he was ousted from the eth devs because he wanted to incorporate ethereum foundation as a for - profit company and everyone else knew that was a terrible idea .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`2 months or so ago it was BTC and ETH ... but since then my BNB bag has jumped to number 1 .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`People do n’t want to use 5 different networks , they want one that offers good yield and dapps and reasonable fees , and BSC will likely suffice for people until eth 2.0 .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Some of the assets ( BTC , ETH , USDT ) are centralized binance pegged assets , but kinda tired hearing people say Binance controls BSC when its simply not factual .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`It has grown to my biggest holding , more than eth and btc , and it ’s making me a little uncomfortable lol .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Things could look differently a month from now , but for now I only see positive signs from the way BTC and ETH have been growing .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Right now BTC and ETH approached the current highest prices rather calmly , telling me this market likely has a lot more room to grow .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm gon na start shilling ETH on Tiktok ... I'll tell the new money that the reason why the fees are so high is because everyone who holds eth becomes so insanely rich that we do n't care that it costs $ 50-$100 in gas to make a swap .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Eip 1559 will definitely help with fees ... but if uniswap v3 also manages to move a lot of volume to L2 by then eth might actually be affordable to use again well ahead of eth 2.0 .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Stellar can support tokens , and has a built in dex ( order books style , not liquidity pool style ) , but eth supports full Turing complete smart contracts that allows for a lot more applications that stellar could support .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I ’ve met people randomly who just learned about crypto but have used BSC irl , and never used Eth . 

 Binance does n’t have to push up bnb , it ’s actually got a ton of usage at the moment and will continue until eth solves its gas fee problem .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Like I ’m curious how much adoption some of the other chains like Matic are getting relative to eth / bsc .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`[ https://info.honeyswap.org/token/0x1e16aa4df73d29c029d94ceda3e3114ec191e25a](https://info.honeyswap.org/token/0x1e16aa4df73d29c029d94ceda3e3114ec191e25a ) 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 Moons are only 12 cents on honeyswap ... liquidity on uniswap is a fraction of honeyswap and not even sure if you can bridge them back and forth to eth anymore .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`1inch launched a wallet app today … I probably wo n’t use it but sounds kinda useful for a newcomer , you can easily get the best rates on eth and bsc and not have to pay the crazy fee MetaMask charges for swapping within their wallet ( almost 1 % ) .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`At a recent summit , Vitalik said the optimistic launch date for eth 2.0 is the end of this year .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Holy shit , I just realized ETH could potentially flip BTC for the number one spot in the next year , getting close to 50 % of btc ’s marketcap .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`I let it mine almost 24/7 , and it earned $ 6-$12 in eth per day ( so in December it was making $ 8 of eth a day when eth was under $ 800 ) 

 Because of the price of Eth going up , the gpu basically has paid for the whole computer in just a few months .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Then you just have to follow some guides on YouTube on how to mine eth and fine tune the settings .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Cardano is most certainly speculative too ... people speculate that it will compete with ETH but we ca n't tell because it does n't have full smart contracts yet .`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Most stock charts look amazing for the past 5 years , 
 Not sure how you could have done better with eth going from 2k to 4K.`
jthawks,neither,Ethereum,`Yeah this past year has been fantastic for eth , but there was about 2.5 years that I wish I was in the stock market instead of crypto but I held strong and dca .`

Imroyceo,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd say no , reason being , Ethereum is going to become a big part of our future .`
Imroyceo,favor,Ethereum,`While that 's not guaranteed , I do believe Ethereum is still very undervalued and you 'll be better off just hodling for now .`

pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`The XLM and ETH graphs are very similar which I find somewhat interesting personally 

 Probably just a coincidence tbh`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Looking at maybe putting some of my XLM in there and the rest in ETH`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Me : sitting here with a buy order for when it dips to $ 1510 

 ETH : “ lmao never going back down there again ! ”`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`The new Bitcoin /s 

 I think it ’ll go up a bit , it ’s a coin with solid footing that is cheap unlike ETH ( which is still great ) so those coming from DOGE might flock to it instead`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I m new here and I have none in BTC and most in ETH tbh 

 I m sure I ’ll regret that , but ETH seems like it ’s on the rise and it ’s cheaper`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Rate my wallet : 

 - ETH 
 - XLM 
 - ADA 

 Thinking of hopping on the XMR train as well as BTC .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`What wallets let you stake ETH ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I thought about going higher but 31 is my lucky number and I ’ve diversified , so I do n’t want to put it all in ETH ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I really thought about getting into crypto last August which would have led me here 

 If I did , I ’d have hopped on ETH then :(`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`If gas fees were n’t so high with ETH I think we ’d have a massive sell off for ADA lol`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH chart is practically identical recently , at least last I checked .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`My understanding is ETH is n’t really an alt anymore either`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Rate my monthly DCA ( not naming the price ) 

 - 	 20 % BTC 
 - 	 15 % ETH 
 - 	 15 % ADA 
 - 	 10 % ATOM 
 - 	 10 % ZIL 
 - 	 10 % BNB 
 - 	 10 % DOT 
 - 	 10 % NANO 

 Figured BTC was lacking in my portfolio and it ’s smart to try and bring that up .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Oh I already have a healthy portfolio going , right now BTC is behind ADA and ETH though .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`That was more of a FOMO DCA and I think I ’m better off with that money elsewhere 

 I redistributed it so it ’s : 

 - 	 20 % BTC 
 - 	 20 % ADA 
 - 	 20 % ETH 
 - 	 15 % DOT 
 - 	 10 % ATOM 
 - 	 10 % ZIL 
 - 	 5 % NANO 

 I know NANO is popular and shilled a ton , but I feel like ZIL is very promising .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I m still going to DCA ETH , but I think I ’m going to DCA less of it .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`

 Tons of people in here claiming ETH is done`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m curious , for the ETH holders currently : 

 Are you planning on selling because you ’re sick of gas fees and putting in elsewhere ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`You ’ll almost certainly see BTC near $ 60k again , same with ETH above $ 2k 

 If you hold and are patient , you wo n’t lose everything ( if you ’re in the correct coin , there ’s obviously coins that have failed miserably )`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`It feels like people are hopping on the ADA train left and right and leaving ETH , and the only reason they ’re still with ETH is the gas fees and people have told them it ’s stable`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Considering dropping my ALGO for something else , or putting it all into a different coin 

 I think I ’m spread too thin with my portfolio being : 

 ADA , ETH , BTC , ZIL , ATOM , NANO , ALGO , and BNB ( though BNB is for the reduced fees and I have barely any of that ) 

 Might put ALGO into UNI or ATOM but I ’m not sure 

 I know I ’m just talking here and I ’m doing my own research on the side lol`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Mainly the bridge to ETH for ZIL and I ’m very bullish on it in general for a ton of reasons 

 I do have a ton of ADA already , because of the recent pump it ’s the biggest portion of my portfolio lol .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`While I think the project is interesting , I just feel like it ’s going to 3rd wheel off of ETH and ADA`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`So NFTs taking off is very bullish for ETH , right ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Swapping what little ALGO I have into ZIL ( or waiting for the ETH / BTC dip ) 

 Yay or nay ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`My ALGO is n’t even enough to swap it on Binance lol , so I ’m gon na exchange it for ETH on Exodus and call it good , since you ca n’t swap for ZIL on there`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Aside from power usage , is there a negative side to mining ETH with your rig ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`ZIL has the ETH bridge coming and Cuban has RTed them and Chamath asked them to DM him`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`So one of my best accidents recently is when I built my PC last summer , I decided to get a cheaper GPU while I wait for the big announcements of the 3080 to try and cop a 3080 or a 2080 on sale 

 So I got a 5700xt , which apparently is the most efficient mining GPU ( at least for ETH ) from what I ’ve seen lol .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`This is another reason to be so bullish on ZIL : 

 The ecological footprint of ZIL mining has considerably been reduced in a way that only 1 minute out of every 1.5 hours is needed to mine ZIL , allowing one to dual - mine other chains such as Ethereum ( ETH ) or Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) at the same time or more specifically the rest of the time 

 This means that I can mine ETH and then every 1.5 hours for 1 minute my miner switches over and mines ZIL .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s not that it does n’t pollute , though that ’s a plus , it ’s that I can dual mine with ETH and ZIL with my gaming rig without any extra effort 

 I ’ve always been bullish on ZIL for many reasons , so learning this today is nice for me lol .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`NANO for ZIL and ETH is what I did last night 

 ATOM can probably stay`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Thinking of dropping my ADA bag and splitting it up for 25 % ZIL , 25 % ATOM , 25 % BTC , 25 % ETH 

 Thinking of taking 5 % off all 4 of those and putting it into another coin as well , so shill me your best low cap moonshot`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`In the ETH chaos everyone is missing that BTC is closing in on $ 60k`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`

 Put it this way , you buy deposit money and buy 1 ETH .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Now you ’ve essentially gotten a free 1 ETH without having to pay anything , as it ’s off their exchange`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m hoping one of those ships is the ETH at $ 2k ships lol`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Is ETH pumping because of Berlin ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Would ya look at that , got my 2nd ETH mining payout at 0.05 

 Got ta love single GPU mining`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Tons of coins are built on ETH is why it ’s so popular`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I fear ETH is going to dump hard when that happens .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`They ’re on Robinhood and they think they found a discounted version of ETH and BTC`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Just use one of these comments ! 

 - 	 Holy shit VET ! 
 - 	 DOGE is bad 
 - 	 Buy more LTO ! 
 - 	 Buy more VET ! 
 - 	 Fuck Elon Musk 
 - 	 Buy high sell low 
 - 	 Time in the market & gt ; timing the market 
 - 	 ETH is breaking out !`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`They have a cool down period of like 5 days from depositing cash to being able to pull out that amount to go off wallet 

 This way you do n’t buy $ 5000 of ETH and pull it off wallet and then the charge declines and you get $ 5000 worth of free ETH because they ca n’t just take the ETH back once it ’s off wallet 

 I usually have enough on there to pull off exchange when I need to for situations like this but I do n’t at the moment .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I was at something like 0.04 ETH a month on my gaming PC doing single GPU mining roughly around a month ago 

 Due to the huge amount of transactions from all the newbies it ’s at an estimated 0.09 ETH a month now lol`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I think my ultimate goal is to get enough money to fund a private pilot ’s license and then enough money to buy my own small 4 - 5 seater plane 

 I ’m a long way off but I hope ETH gets me there some day`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Yes , I promise to 5x your ETH is 1 year`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I also think ETH 2.0 will help drive away the stigma that crypto is bad for the environment .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`PoW is obviously a huge power draw and with the second biggest crypto moving to PoS , which uses much less energy , I think will really help with that image and maybe even propel it to the flippening 

 For reference , right now ETH consumes as much electricity as Iceland roughly ( from what I ’ve found , this is in 2019 though , it ’s probably more now ) .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`My understanding is that on PoS , ETH 2.0 is expected to use 1 % of the energy consumed now by PoW`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I know LTO is a long term hodl but I ’m very tempted to just cash out and put it all into ETH`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s a steady growth and safe , but ETH is pretty safe as well 

 I ’ll be moving my alts into something like 80 % ETH/20 % BTC in a couple of months or so and then sitting out the rest of the bull run / the bear run there until the next cycle starts up .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`BTC & amp ; ETH and then do research on other altcoins that have actual use cases and projects 

 Congrats on realizing it ’s becoming an issue !`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is at least implementing a fix with 2.0 and PoS. 

 BTC will be around for a while because people know crypto as Bitcoin and do n’t even know ETH exists`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I wonder if ETH ’s gain on the ratio is in part due to the BTC fees being through the roof ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I know ETH has worse fees , but they ’re at least doing something about it`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`… .you do know it has to gain $ 200 billion in market cap to flip ETH right ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Just had someone tell me that BNB is going to flip ETH in a few weeks -______-`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`… .you do realize it has to gain roughly $ 200 billion in market cap on ETH * and * with ETH going on this insane run right ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s just a 5700xt I ’m running on , I did n’t take into account electricity but I ’m getting 55 mh / s at 108 W which is good for roughly 0.08 ETH a month according to Ethermine .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`This is a big reason why I think ETH will flip BTC .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`While ETH uses PoW at the moment , they ’re switching to 2.0 and PoS which is about 1 % of the current energy they ’re using 

 If they ’re smart , they can market this against BTC as being an environmentally friendly coin .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I wish I had a full ETH :(`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s precisely why I ’m just holding my ETH in Coinbase for now instead of transferring it to my Ledger`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is also moving away from PoS which means it ’s going to be a lot more environmentally friendly`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`When ETH is your worst performing coin of the day at 15.15 % gains , you know you ’re having a fantastic day`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I woke up and misread a CoinGecko notification about BTC ( I ’ve only ever seen ETH from them … ) that ETH hit $ 5300 

 I about shit my pants`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`lol there ’s now a “ ETH is heading towards it ’s ATH ” post , as if the “ ETH hit a new ATH ” is n’t already enough`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`This is the 2nd time ETH has broken it ’s ATH in the last 5 days , we do n’t need a post every time 

 Save these posts for big milestones like every $ 1k`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Because of buy the rumor , sell the news ETH will crash when 2.0 comes out and this sub will inevitably freak the fuck out thinking it was a failure and panic sell 

 Then 2 days later will rocket well beyond the moon and people panicking will FOMO back in`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Especially when people realize it ’ll take a lot more to 2x on BTC that it would on say ETH`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Update : the scammer is n’t interested in giving me 1 ETH in promise of returning 10 :(`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`He responded with “ how do you mean ? ? ? ” , so I think I piqued his interest lol 

 I then said I could show him if he sent me 1 ETH , that I ’d send him 10 back .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I have n’t taken my ETH off exchange because of the fees .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s also moving to POS , which is said to use something like 1 % of the energy ETH is currently using , so it ’s more environmental as well 

 Considering that ’s a big complaint about crypto and the second biggest crypto is actively working towards fixing that issue is bullish for crypto in my opinion .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`

 When ETH becomes more widely known and on POS and use a lot less energy ( which is a big reason why I think ETH will overtake BTC eventually too ) people will find a different argument as to why crypto is bad .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`ETH will apparently only use 1 % of the current energy being used in order to run the network when moving to POS is done 

 I also think the whole BTC being environmentally damaging thing is very overblown , which this article says .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`They think it ’s a cheap ETH`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`What if the flippening is n’t because of ETH rising faster than BTC , it ’s because of BTC dropping ? 

 ( Yes I know it wo n’t happen like this , it ’s just an interesting thought since ETH seems to be moving more independently now )`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I should probably sell too and put the money in ALGO or ETH or something , but I literally just bought at like $ 18 

 Was the launch page super bad ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Sure , BTC and ETH started before then , but it really took off after GME`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Got ta love how mainstream ETH is getting .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Report Finds Earth Is Becoming Increasingly Interested in Bitcoin , Ethereum and Stablecoins`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Did you know that if you used Orion and their terminal to buy ETH over buying ETH on Uniswap , you ’d save roughly $ 150 because ORN aggregates order books from multiple exchanges and gives you the best price ?`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`It actually makes sense if you ’re sending say BTC or ETH .`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I was going to sell at $ 23 and put the profits into ETH but the unbonding period is taking so long it ’s saving my ass lol`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go watch ETH cross $ 1400 !`
pm_me_cute_sloths_,favor,Ethereum,`I read that using Orion instead of uniswap to buy ETH can save you like $ 150 on gas fees`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Eth was an early comer and maybe the first DeFi crypto if i m not mistaken , it is therefore uaed on the vast majority of Defi applications and Dapps , however the gas fees have gotten way too expensive and the transaction speed is very slow , ADA is a newer currency deemed by some as " eth killer " because it promises lower fees and faster transactions , however the bottomline is their developers keep on promising on and on and they do nt even run on smart contracts yet .. we have to see how 2021 plays out because they presumably are deploying their smart chain in a few months and ETH will also implement ETH 2.0 which will lower the gas fees somewhat .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`It comes down to how much you trust the developers of either network , non of us knows how good ETH 2.0 or ADA eith smart contracts will be , with that being said , ADA uses an easier programming language but all the big applications arw already running on etherium so if you are waiting for ADA to dethrone ETH then buckle up for the long run .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`The thing that really helped BNB rally is the introduction of BSC , which enabled people to participate in DeFi without having to pay insane gas fees which they otherwise would have needed to pay on ETH`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Like 2 sports teams from 2 different sports would be a more accurate analogy , btc and eth serve different purposes , one is a solid selfproven store of value , the other has a lot of uses cases in the Defi space , the whole clash between the 2 is redundant , not only they can coexist but they benefit from one another .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah I believe so , ETH 2.0 gas fees wo nt be much lower than they already are , ADA is the future`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Nah do nt worry eth is going to 3k in a couple months`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`The thing about btc is its the most recognised cryptocurrency in the mainstream , however ETH has a lot more applications and use cases so it is nt just a " store of value " as btc is deemed to be .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH is to overtake btc I think it will take a very long time for the general public to become more aquainted with it and the feasibility it bring to businesses .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`It is worth noting that ETH is going to face a lot of competition in the enar future with promising projects like ALGO , Polkadot , ADA , and others who promise to bring similar services with cheaper gas fees and faster transactions .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`This is what I call valuable digital assets , people who bable about investing in ETH take a look at this real treasury`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Your going out of your mind , nothing will resist ETH GOING 🚀`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`For all my fellow ETH bretheren , let us grab a toast for this glorious milestone .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Where are all the ETH haters who said it was a shitcoin because of gas fees ?`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Idgaf if you hold DOGE , VET or ETH , I m just happy we 're all making cash $ $ .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Its incresible how ETH has nt even dipped that hard through the whole market dip , the amount of ETH holders is pretty much at an ATH so it wo nt take long before it hits 3k .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I remember my first time buying $ 100 worth of ETH thinking that s it i m the big deal now , only to be devastated after paying $ 60 to transfer it from metamask to an exchange .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Now that is nt to say you should nt buy some ETH on an exchange directly to hodl if you are dealing with small amounts of money .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I honestly think ETH is poised to absolutely explode to the moon in the next few weeks ; The number of ETH holders is at an ATH and keeps going up , and it has nt even dipped that much sitting pretty at around $ 2250 , so hodl with me and lets ride to glory`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`To all peoppe griefing over not investing in BTC in 2018 , ETH in 2024 will be what BTC is today`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`In short , you 're saying ETH is the BTC killer , gotcha`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is riding an unstoppable one way rocket , that last ATH a week ago was childs play , we 've seen nothin yet`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`As I 've already said , ETH is batman of crypto , petty whales are not enough to stop it from rocketing to mars , I write this while sipping champagne and watching green candles`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I hope you 're all in VET and ETH , you 'll get plenty of it here`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Chat is so fast I hope it wo nt notice I sold my mom for ETH`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I mean the dope ETH logo alone is enough to make you go all in`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH does not recognize the word " bearish "`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I used to fail my work , my kids , alcohol , drugs , you name it , I was a conplete failure , but then I invested into ETH , now i m officially a successmann while still doing the aforementined stuff`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH to   new ATH by 2morrow , let us leap towards glory my brothers !`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Our asian crypto bretheren will help us reach dat ETH new ATH in no time`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`My brother just sold as his ETH which means its probably hitting 3k tomorrow`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH holds the keys to Charlie 's chocolate factory , its heading on a one way train to glory and petty bears will get smothered on its path`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH hits its ATH tomorrow i m quitting my job and telling my boss fuck you`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`There is nothing wrong at going all in on ETH at an ATH since its reaching a new ATH a week later`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I ca nt help but picture Bitcoin as Exodia pinning down that bear while ETH as batman unleashing his power up that poor bears huhu`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Dayum you knew ETH was going to exist all along`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`BTC hovering around the 55k mark while ETH is riding a moon train just shows that its finally deviating from BTC trends and is losing its dependance on it . who knowe maybe someday ETH will flip BTC`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`BTC tech is kind of outdated rn compared to other newer projects like ETH , also it has alr had its bull run and its hard to imagine giving you 5 fold your investment 1 - 2 years down the line`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I m a simple man , I see ETH I buy it .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`The " gas fee fiasco " has alr been kind of figured out , the fees have been halfed just recently with the introduction of flashbots and will be even cheaper when ETH 2.0 comes out`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`You are right about the no cap supply , but you need to take into consideration EIP-1559 fee burn which some expect will make ETH deflationary`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Lol at all those BTC fanboy maximalists trying to downvote me for trying to reason with them why ETH economy structure is more sustainable and has better potential to grow`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Would you say 95 % ETH is a disversified portfolio ?`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Bold pf you to call the ETH dev team lazy considering BSC has ETH 's code copy pasted .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I just sold my last EOS holdings for ETH and i m proud , there is no holding back`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine going short on ETH , that s what my BTC maximalist brother did a week ago , now I drink champagne while he drinks plain water .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Payday is comin , ETH is breaking 3k in 2 days time , you heard it here first`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`It does nt matter if ETH gets a healthy correction , in the big picture its only heading in one direction , to the moon`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Around july and the answer is probably no , you 'll have to wait for ETH 2.0`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`To all ETH holders go to sleep and wait for the asian market to wake up and start pooompin it for yet another ATH`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`The only reason I have nt spent all my fiat money on ETH is I saved some for when it hits a new ATH so I can celebrate with you all by buying more ETH`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I was bottomline joking about goin all in on ETH .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`* ETH * : hey gee , what we gon na do today ?`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH do nt give no fks aboit bear markets , the only way is up`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Ok guys , since ETH hitting 3k tonight is a no brainer , i m leveraging x50 on ETH long , follow me to victory my brothers .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`For all regular ETH HODLers like myself who 've been staring at the charts for the past 4 hours straight , we may need to spend a long night of more staring until asian money finally pump it to 3000 .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Science of HODL has proven that if you stare at the ETH charts long enough religiously , it moves up .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I m a simple man , I see ETH ATH I buy and wait for the next`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I just canceled my $ 3500 sell order for ETH , I do nt settle with mediocrity`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin tech outdated , ETH rocket activated 🚀`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is about as close from hitting 3k as GSW were from beating the cavs`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Here is the thing , ETH is hitting 5k by the end of May , I do nt like to be overly optimistic`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Buying more ETH Zwhile being high on meth , trust me its worked to a tee`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`When I first got into crypto , I did nt know much besides the names of the coins , and I only had like $ 300 to invest which was just enough to buy a full ETH coin .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I am not someone who likes to own a fraction of something so I said f bitcoin i m buying my whole ETH coin , look at the results .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH going a little sideways the past hour , milestones are nt reached wothout a fight , lets hodl and make that 3000 happen ! !`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I hope ETH makes up a large chunk of your portfolio`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Traditional wisdom says buy the dip sell the top , but ETH simply does nt abide by the laws of physics , todays ATH is tomorrows dip`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Enjoy your gains and profits ETH and VET HODLers , trust me this is far from the peak`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`We all know batman ETH is great at climbing walls , aaaaaaaaany moment now , stay tuned for the confetti`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`All these candy asses thinking selling their ETH will stop it from climbing the 3k wall today`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`If you are hyped about ETH hitting 3k , [ here](https://aggr.trade/ # ) is a link to track its price by the second , lets watch greatness unfold together !`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Meanwhile I m celebrating at my moms basement for owning a whole ETH coin .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Guys I think I found a very promising coin with great potential called ETH , I think it might have a good future , maybe .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Back around 3 months ago , I was determined to get loaded with ETH as soon as a dip hits , I m still waiting tho`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH hits 3k yesterday , everyone goes yay , 1 day later ETH holders go :           

 4k when ?`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`For every VET HODLer I know its tough looking at all the ETH success while we do nt see much action , but remember good things come to those who wait , so lets HODL together strong and wait for the imminent explosion of VET to the moon`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`ETH makes banks look bearish`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Skeptics wonder what will happen to ETH when a bear market strikes .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I alr bought ETC now I need someone to tell me how to convert it to ETH`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I bought a shitton of ETC cuz I was told I could turn it into juicy ETH if I put it for 90 seconds in microwave on defrost`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`People thought they could turn ETC to juicy ETH if they put it in microwave for 90 seconds on defrost`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Wtf you 're telling me I ca nt convert my ETC to actual ETH ?`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`I see ETH breaking $ 3600 tonight and hit yet another ATH , the march to 4k shall be swift`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`The thing that scares me is banks could potentially buy loads of ETH for example to pump its price up and make the gas fees so unbearable that the DeFi market takes a hit for the average person .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`A stock that basically follows the price of ETH , which looks somewhat reduntant since it will kinda feels like buying crypto on Robinhood         
      

 2 .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`4k eth in a week proves that santa is real and wonderland does exist`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Because people want to use their ETH for staking , yield farming and others Dapp applications instead of sitting on it like you would with bitcoin since you ca nt do anything with bitcoin anything beside holding anways .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`The only reasons it got pumped so hard is its listed on Robbinghood and newcomers thought its somehow correlated to the real ETH .`
Probetsman,favor,Ethereum,`Haha I m mainly an ETH holder , i m very happy stop being so corny`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`DPI is a great hold , if you believe it may outperform ETH .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`LINK / BTC has been in a bear market for months , LINK / USD is doing well , but BTC / USD has been doing better 

 Traditionally , LINK does n’t pump at the same time as BTC or ETH , but towards the summer ... link is gon na be pretty hot`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`If I were to sort them my risk , I ’d say XLM is the least risky , then ETH , then ADA .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Using a dApp on the Ethereum blockchain may be worthwhile if working with larger sums , due to the high fees .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`You might say , oh but LINK / USD has been rising how is it in a bear market , but contrary to popular beliefs , it ’s possible to be in a bear market relative to BTC / ETH , all while at the same time increasing in value .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`So it makes sense that these get outperformed by BTC , ETH , etc .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`If you think 2100 is the top it ’s sort of ridiculous to hold ETH as opposed to BTC .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`If a 5 figure ETH is possible , that means this price discovery could be quite impressive , but not sure 5 figures will happen at the current time .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`The main idea that may counter that point , is if you consider ETH + DeFi , since you can imagine a lot of potential ETH is in DeFi .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2k is almost guaranteed , what ’s interesting is where will the new price discovery take us`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH is undervalued relative to BTC .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`It seems ETH is outperforming DeFi tokens for once`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s not controversial to say that during a bull market everything in general is overvalued , because in general people are speculating on the price of   BTC , ETH , BSC , MATIC , mooncoin , etc .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m not mad it ’s just silly since it ’s a top token , I got well over half my crypto in ETH , along with bags of DeFi .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Yea I do n’t really understand the perceived FUD , it seems people are trying to get others to sell their ETH to buy X token , seems rather self serving and biased .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Having a smaller percentage in some other tokens you believe could outperform ETH would n’t be a bad idea , but as you do that you may increase your risk .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH bears : “ Somethings wrong I can feel it ”`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Lowkey we know 2k is only a small step towards the true value of Ethereum`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH bears must be feeling like that first verse on rap god by Eminem : “ somethings wrong I can feel it ” ...`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH bulls let ’s crush the previous high`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’ll say it now , while you may think you missed you chance to hop on ETH , or to increase your bags .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Of course there has been better days to buy , but it ’s not too late and ETH can safely double from here , and you ’re still early in terms of reaching 5 figures .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Essentially , a trend that ’s happening on the day chart of ETH / BTC , suggests ETH is ratio will increase relative to BTC .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m looking to enter with 5k more in fresh powder , I could add to ETH , but I ’m really more interested in a riskier lower cap .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Why you say it like ATOM is entitled to be in my bag , from my POV it seems to be doing worse that ETH , so maybe it ’s not worth jumping in now .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH pumping is long overdue , congrats to everyone who ’s been holding , it surely has been worth it so far`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`When you first bought ETH at 600 and it pumped to 1k , and you sold but then bought back in cause you realized it was the real deal`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Something I ’ve noticed is that the MKR tokens roughly foreshadows how high ETH can go short term .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m getting some January vibes were ETH and DeFi were pumping while BTC consolidated a bit`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Sushiswap is nice as you ’re rewarded with sushi for providing liquidity to a trading pair such as LINK / ETH , SUSHI / ETH , YFI / ETH , etc . before doing this I ’d recommend getting informed about impermanent loss .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Right now , it seems ETH is doing good relative to BTC , this trend may or may not continue .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH doing it ’s daily retest of 0.04 on the ETH / BTC , or will BTC dump ?`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`It appears ETH is causing BTC to climb as well , hurry up old man !`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I see ETH I upvote , especially when paired with the bullish rocket`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s get 300B market cap ETH , doge holders are welcome !`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Cmon ETH let ’s get that 0.0425 ratio secured`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH : hits 20k 

 Future me : damn I should ’ve bought more ETH 🤡`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’d say LINK sorta does it own thing , maybe mildly correlated to ETH`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`At this point I ’m convinced BTC dominance will drop towards 40 % , w ETH leading the way`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH let ’s secure 0.0425`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Just bought more ETH , what ’s it to yah`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is just about my least stress - inducing hodl , what you talking about`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Is the market in awe just watching ETH finally shine ... brings a tear to me eye 🥲`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I have a feeling we ’re going to start seeing ETH climb up relatively quickly`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m really glad I did n’t liquidate my ETH bags in expectation of a crash like many may have done`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH strikes the right balance of risk / reward 

 Risk : safe 

 Reward : 🚀`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s not that crazy at all and better than expected 

 For context : ETH pumps when BTC cools down`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Yea VET / ETH chart looks about due for a corrections , perhaps the veterans are behind the ETH pump 🤔`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Who ’s glad they are invested into ETH , or better yet ETH and DeFi ?`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m liking these ETH / BTC daily closes !`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I noticed VET has been underperforming ETH as of late , that ’s not to say VET does n’t have more room to grow`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m currently down on some ETH due to impermanent loss on the SUSHI / ETH pair , so if you folks do n’t mind pumping 🍣 for a second that would be cool 😎`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH / BTC ratio relates to the price of 1 ETH divided by the price of 1 BTC 

 ETH / BTC = 2717/54549 = 0.0498 , 
 it hit 0.05 a few minutes ago 

 In March the ration was more like 0.030 , so it indicated that ’s this month ETH has been outperforming BTC considerably by over 60 % .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`

 Moreover , it just means ETH has been a better hold recently , and could continue to do so , but really it goes through shifts .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Some months btc does better , some months ETH does better , and so on , but generally ETH gains on btc on the big picture when we ’re talking years .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I called $ 3,333 ETH earlier this month ... let ’s see if it plays out`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I believe BTC will reach at least 100k , so no reason that would be the top for ETH`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I know LINK and ETH are popular around here , but it seems ETH has been outperforming LINK for the past 6 months ... is there an expectation that LINK will do better soon ?`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Seems like each $ 100 increase for ETH is getting easier and easier`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Yea as it allows them room to grow since the BTC market share is decreasing , once BTC takes the spotlight ETH will not be growing at the same rate , but really it ’s expected I ’d say .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`These crypto YouTube ads are straight scams .... sent 5 - 500 ETH , get 10 - 1000 ETH back ? ? ?`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Just bought more ETH , what ’s it to yah ? 🚀`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH / BTC ratio looking good as ever`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`MKR is my ETH price foreshadow , I always noticed MKR pumps away , and ETH closes that gap after some time .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Just a casual new ETH / BTC high , not ath as its historically been higher but you know what I mean 

 0.054 ETH / BTC`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`My best move so far , is no move at all , just letting ETH , DeFi , BTC do their thing .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I was freaking out when ETH / BTC dipped from 0.052 to 0.046 , but held my ground and now we ’re at 0.054 , with ETH continuing to show strong momentum .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`BTC is doing exactly what one would want if they are holding ETH .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`What ’s up w VET , I did n’t buy into it , it seems to be consolidating and underperforming ETH as of late ... since April 19th .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`It makes ETH even better , like what many ETH killers say they will be .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`In terms of what it does is that it basically makes interacting with the blockchain very affordable if not free , which is a primary complaint of many Ethereum blockchain users , as gas fees are high .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Welp you may as well break up now , ETH is only gon na continue to swell right inside your girl .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH / USD pair along with the ETH / BTC pair have been making me very happy as of late`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s buy up that sweet ETH 🚀`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`BTC continuing to consolidate while at the same time not crashing , is only good for ETH / Alts .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`BTC will do well regardless of what ETH is doing .`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`at what point will it be BTC / ETH , rather than ETH / BTC 🤔`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Seeing ETH above 3k makes me feel good`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH : hits 100k 

 Me : we earlyyyy 🤩`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`Ngl I do believe you , but not sure if I should come in with fresh USD or use some of my ETH`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’d argue ETH has more upwards potential than pump and dump doge`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH gas fees are the ultimate encouragement for holding at least until ETH2.0`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`If i know one thing , it ’s that hodling ETH has proven to be quite a profitable endeavor that ’s for sure`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I woke up to 3700 ETH i can only imagine how you feel 🤩`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`based on my experience BTC , ETH , doge 🤡 , ADA , LTC , LINK , VET , XLM ? , ATOM , MATIC , ONE ? , are popular around here .. did I miss something ?`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`MKR has been outperforming ETH , they were close to 1:1 earlier this year`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH : hits 100k 

 Me : we earlyyyy 🤩`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`ETH can only help BTC so much , BTC needs to grow a pair`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m fucking w this ETH price discovery , anyone got some more of it ?`
abesWaves,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s ETH tsunami , soon others will follow I ’d imagine`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Here are the basics : 

 When Ethereum became publicly available to trade in 2015 the price of Ether relative to Bitcoin was \~.0038 .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Look at how Ethereum is planning on scaling without compromising decentralization .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Safest strategy is to invest the vast majority in Bitcoin and Ethereum and balancing them based on your own understanding of which has a better chance of making it the next 5 - 10 years .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I have given a lot of thought to this subject and I feel very confident that Ethereum will eventually become the dominant crypto currency .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`

 I have put most of my thoughts into a few posts for those who are interested : 

 * [ A theory of why Ethereum is perhaps better " sound money " than Bitcoin.](https://www.reddit.com / r / ethereum / comments / ijj2ch / a_theory_of_why_ethereum_is_perhaps_better_sound/ )

 * [ The threat to Bitcoin that no one is talking about.](https://www.reddit.com / r / CryptoCurrency / comments / k46gge / the_threat_to_bitcoin_that_no_one_is_talking_about/ )`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`That is assuming BTC 's price will grow faster than ETH .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This going to be bananas and ETH 2.0 will make BTC look like a fart in the wind .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Watch how the narrative will gradually change and how there will be a trend of big talking heads increasingly talking about ETH in a more positive light .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Through staking on ETH 2.0 .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum was rarely mentioned by name , but now investors are staring to admit that Ethereum may overtake Bitcoin at some point .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes , the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the Ether token become .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Some people prefer to say that Ether is just an utility token .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes , the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the Ether token become .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This is it in   a nutshell , Bitcoin and Ethereum are the organic growth of new monetary assets in the form of digital gold and digital money respectively .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I prefer Bitcoin and Ethereum to gold , and given the circumstances and upside potential I would say that any less than a 5 % allocation is financially irresponsible .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`There is a general understanding and CONSENSUS from the Ethereum community that the flexibility of issuance is done in order to serve security purposes .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The development of Bitcoin and Ethereum is somewhat centralized ... it would be near impossible to achieve progress in something as complex as crypto without some level of centralization .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`If it happens there will be no point to holding Bitcoin if Ethereum has established a stable and sustainable net zero monetary policy .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum currently is superior in many ways , but not yet as a reserve asset ... hence the question was asked .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Some people prefer to say that Ether is just an utility token .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`You do understand   that currently Ethereum is also PoW , and when it switches to PoS the security will be even more closely tied to the price of Ether right ?`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The reason why BTC is considered digital gold is because of its scarcity , and ETH may be very well on the road to become an even more scarce asset , that has greater utility , with a sustainable monetary policy and that yields returns on top of it all .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`You make a lot of good points , but I have to question why have they gone after Ripple before Ethereum .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Would it be because they want to establish legal precedence with an easier case , or would it be simply because they have no intentions to actually come after Ethereum regardless of how it evolves into the future .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The price of ETH does not affect the cost of each transaction , network congestion and the demand for transacting is the real reason fees become expensive .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Check some of these out if you are interested in learning more about it from a perspective from someone who is bullish on Ether , but not a maximalist .`

TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The high fees are an issue , but they reveal that people are still willing to pay for it to transact with the level of security and decentralization that Ethereum has .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Platforms that are entering this market to compete for the same use cases that Ethereum is already successful will have a very hard time in stealing the market share because the network effect is so strong .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I think the most successful alternative platforms will be the ones that focus on use cases where the levels of security and decentralization that Ethereum offers are not necessary and the cost of transacting is not justified .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`You would imagine that with a highly volatile asset like crypto the ETF would keep up with the NAV specially considering that there is no lack of liquidity for BTC and ETH .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`A lot of Ethereum bulls keep saying that ETH is money , but I have never seen a full breakdown of why they think that way .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Way too many people keep insisting that Ethereum is not trying to be money and that it does not compete in any way with Bitcoin .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`There are [ a few different ways](https://www.reddit.com / r / CryptoCurrency / comments / kb3hd5 / ether_is_a_mixture_of_commodity_currency_bond_and/ ) to look at what type of asset class Ether is analogous to .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This is what is different ... the utility of ether is exclusively derived from what it is worth as a monetary medium , nothing else .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The speed of the transaction and the mechanism in which how it is performed are not affected by how much ether you paid for it .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`With ethereum , when the price of ether goes up the price for gas goes down ... that is because ether is being used as money .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`So the end result of all these factors put together may create the impression that the exact opposite of what I originally suggested is true : that when price of ether goes up the dollar price of transactions goes up even higher .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I think we will see this type of situation during bubbles , but I also think that the net result during capitulation and accumulation phases will show that there is a negative correlation between the dollar denomination price of ether and the ether denomination price of gas .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`The issue is that this opens the way for false narratives like that Bitcoin and Ethereum are completely different things and they are not competing with each other on any level .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`

 Once there is the understanding that ether is money , it is possible to see how saying that Bitcoin and Ethereum do not compete is equivalent to saying that fax machines and the internet do not compete .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`However in the meantime I can at least make an anecdotal observation that every time I use Ethereum I never really pay attention to costs in terms of ether ... my perception of cost is entirely based on how many dollars it will take for the transaction to go through .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I think it is common sense and rational assumption to say that people ’s willingness to transact is based on the dollar denominated cost rather than ether .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`If people are looking the the dollar cost of transactions , then it means that the ether denomination of gas price goes down when the the dollar denomination of ether goes up .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`For starters I do n't like the history of how / why Charles stepped away from Ethereum .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`With that said , I noticed that Charles reached out to Jack because they are working on implementing a decentralized version of Twitter ... this is exactly the kind of stuff that can pay off if it done right , and it is something that Ethereum can not currently handle .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I also think it will be very important for ETH competitors to build bridges to Ethereum .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Miners will continue to mine , and hash rate will continue to grow as long as profit margins are good ... making Ether more scarce will also drive its price up , so even from that angle the loss of profit from burned fees will be countered ( to some degree ) by the increase of ether 's price .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This may seem unimportant , but it is a very significant difference between Ethereum and other PoS protocols ( to my knowledge ETH is the only one that does not rely on delegation ) .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Other than that kudos to them for building a bridge to Ethereum and having a live implementation of sharding and smart contracts .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is not stopping at the moon ... it is not stopping on Mars ... it is going straight out of the milky way in search for alien life ...`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Ether will continue to be ether when 2.0 rolls out ... you wo n't have to do anything do " get the update " .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I just do n't think other chains will be successful by trying to emulate exactly what ETH is doing .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`
 ETH 's issuance is pretty high , and it if ether the prices continues to go up it will be more than enough to make miners quite profitable ... and it may actually be difficult for hash rates to keep up .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Big miners are also not happy about ETH 2.0 ... but in the meantime they will be happy when the price of ETH moons ( in part because of EIP-1559 ) .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I did not say that she likes Ethereum or that she is personally invested in it .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`
 I might try to address her critiques in a future post ... there is a divergence of opinions over many topics she discussed , and I think part of the reason she recognized that it is not crazy to allocate in Ethereum is because she can not definitively say that s bad or good investment .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is a global computer , but it is quite difficult to understand what this truly means and why it is so important .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`He does n't understand ETH 1.0 , he does not see that ether is money and that it consequentially competes with bitcoin .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`His views on ETH are as level headed as saying that the laws of thermodynamics can be applied to Bitcoin because it conserves " monetary energy " that can not be destroyed .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`He said that Ethereum does not know what it wants to be , and used the flying shark analogy in this context .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`He does not even understands that ether is money and that is on its way to becoming harder than bitcoin .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Otherwise it will depend how much of a mess comes out of a contentious hard fork and FUD that would arise from conflicts within the Ethereum community .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`In short , it may seem like other networks are competing with Ethereum , but I think in time it will become more evident that they are complementing it .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`My main goal is to put all the information I have collected over 4 years of following this market into a single document that will hopefully be helping to change the narrative around Ethereum .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`We are still in a highly experimental phase for use cases and dApps ... some of the dApps created on top of Ethereum today may be successful in the long run , but it is so difficult to find out which ones will do well and which will fail .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This means big money is in Ethereum because they are the ones driving the price of ether and transaction cost up .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think Ethereum investors have any issue with how the developers originally raised money , but there are possible regulatory implications .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`That means that if transaction revenue is maintained at current levels it will actually make ETH become a deflationary asset once PoW is completely discontinued because issuance will be reduced to 1 % .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Ether is used as a medium of exchange for digital assets natively defined in the Ethereum protocol ... that includes all ICO 's and NFT 's .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Store of value is mostly driven by scarcity ... currently Bitcoin has a lower issuance rate when compared to Ethereum , and that makes it more scarce ( for now ) .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`However , ether is a million miles ahead in terms of facilitating economic activity because of ICO 's , DeFi and NFT 's as well as the total transaction fee revenue .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I have been working on an investment thesis about Ethereum and I talk a whole lot about why it is the closest thing to a currency and why that is so important to drive the value of ether .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`

 The efficiency provided Ethereum is not just the raw number of transactions that it can process , but the fundamental way in which it process them eliminates inefficiencies from traditional siloed systems that are permissioned and reliant on trust .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`2.5 % is a conservative projection of what the yield will be once ETH 2.0 is finalized .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`5 months " Lets check back on how Ethereum is doing ... "`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`I have added a piece to the [ Ethereum bull case thesis](https://docs.google.com / document / d/11oCA9iPtv6s - twhW6PdSpiENKCbeW7aJJO9Jv8KEc2 g ) to discuss this in more detail : 

 & gt;As of 2021 - 04 - 17 , Ethereum has been sustaining high transaction costs .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This idea needs to be addressed taking into consideration what was previously discussed about how Ethereum Killers sacrifice persistence and permanence for scalability .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is not * making * transactions expensive ( the supply of Ethereum block space has not changed ) ; transaction cost has been driven by user demand .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This means that Ethereum is attracting the highest net worth participants in the smart contracts space .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This is why high transaction fees are being sustained while the price of ether continues to increase .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Most of it will be reversed back to Ethereum once transaction costs have been lowered due to Layer 2 solutions and furthermore with sharding .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is not just a stock , it is the stock market .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`That is precisely the point , ETH is projected to become a superior SoV when compared to BTC , AND it will provide around 2.5 % APY to long term holders on top of it .`
TheWierdGuy,favor,Ethereum,`This is a real problem , and it has inspired me to start writing about Ethereum .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Okay we got $ 16k BTC , ETH it ’s your turn to hit $ 500 now .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I really would love to see an anonymous poll on how much ETH people have .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Sometimes it feels like everyone has thousands and other days it feels like I click on someone giving their history report and financial analytics only has 0.2 ETH .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Personally if we ever see ETH reach $ 2,000 I would quit my job and pursue my passions for awhile .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Watching ETH be so far behind it ’s ATH compared to BTC is a bit maddening .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I dream about being able to quit my job and retire on ETH staking returns .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`That ’s okay , ETH , you pace yourself ; I still believe in you .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH hit $ 496 , we ’re actually finally doing it .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`That would mean essentially 15 whales have staked some of their Ethereum but not many others / normal users .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; Bitcoin is down 1 % for the day 

 & gt ; ETH is up less than 1 % for the day 

 I get excited too easily .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH feels undervalued if I bought anything it would be that IMO .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Where do you think BTC / ETH will be on January 1st 2021 ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`All the Ethereum fans who have been sitting on the sidelines watching Bitcoin go through the roof are finally enjoying the full experience themselves 

 ! [ gif](giphy|xT5LMQ8rHYTDGFG07e )`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`You get 20%+ returns per year paid in ETH for being among the first .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I believe the ATH dream could come true soon for ETH .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is making a lot of dreams come true , RIP to all those who have been selling early hoping to buy back in low .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Look at any ETH chart possible and tell me it does n’t look exciting right now lol`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`If you go with a pool I ’d be sure to use something like RocketPool that will give you a token that is essentially like an “ I.O.U. ETH + staking rewards ” and then theoretically you can sell that at any time for nearly the worth of what you have earned and put in .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`

 Imagine a year ago ETH was only $ 100 and BTC $ 3500 .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Ca n’t relate , on board the ETH hype train , would recommend`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`feels a bit maxi to say ETH is gambling .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Even aside from ETH 2.0 coming along nicely it ’s just a strong pick with a ton of developers , real world use , and growing support to be the backbone of day to day crypto usage .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`BTC is $ 3500 , ETH is $ 120 , and ramen is eaten .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`They ca n’t deny the bulls forever , we push past 19k BTC and 600 ETH again and again until there is no sellers left .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`What might be 90 % of their networth as an extreme answer is often a 17 year old with 1 ETH and what is 5 % of another person could be 100 BTC .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n’t wait for people being depressed about BTC dropping to $ 25k and ETH going under $ 1k next week .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`In crypto anything seems like it could happen , but if the industry is succeeding as a whole I do n’t see ETH being a regretful decision to hold onto in comparison to most .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`So for example if you were interested in Ethereum staking you could look at /r / Ethereum , /r / ETHfinance , and /r / ETHstaker(s ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 is progressing well , more users and devs than ever , and promising news daily .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I knew you could catch up ETH , nice job .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m thinking ETH is in for a very good year personally and we will see 4 digits as the new normal .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Where do you guys see ETH going this bull run ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Yes , you need 32 ETH to independently run your own validator node .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`No , you do not need 32 ETH to stake and services will allow you to pool your ETH with others and split the rewards with as little as 0.1 ETH .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`When you guys sell your BTC for $ 400k and your ETH for $ 10k do you think you could pump Moons to $ 1 ? Thanks`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is up roughly the same percentage for the day , we ’re all on the hype train together`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`If you get burned buying BTC / ETH it just means you did n’t hold long enough , go for it .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I know staking has begun but when are we expecting ETH 2.0 to actually start being used and stakers being paid ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`BTC has already cleared ATH but we ’re right on the threshold of seeing new ETH ATH .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s a bit maddening see BTC going so far with ETH seeming stuck in comparison .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I think we will definitely see ETH pass ATH this run and perhaps 2 - 3x it with a bit of luck .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH $ 2.5k ~ $ 5.5k depending on how sentiment / news look on any given day`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH swinging hundreds of dollars a day in either direction does n’t even phase me anymore .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`If we can gain 566 % for this year too I do n’t care what you call ETH lol`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I am so ready for ETH to hit ATH already .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Wait ETH is doing better than BTC ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I know it is n’t the “ real ” ATH but if you view ETH price on Robinhood it shows ETH currently at ATH and it feels damn good to look at .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Just bought more , let ’s go ETH`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`

 When starting out , it ’s best you stick with the “ safe ” bets of BTC / ETH since crypto is volatile and risky enough .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`We see ETH 2x or -50 % from here first ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Holy shit ETH ATH is happening today , this is not a drill !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`IT ’S FINALLY HAPPENING , LET ’S GO ETH ! 

 !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m so freaking excited to see where ETH can go this year !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Getting ready to buy a bunch more ETH , let ’s get a new ATH . 

 !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`0.04 BTC / ETH finally here , I was told this is when the rocket ship really takes off 

 !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`$ 1 DOGE would make it basically the same market cap as ETH .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Both are great , ETH seems a little more promising with recent news IMO .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Perhaps next year we will be complaining about ETH dipping back under $ 5k and BTC going back under $ 100k .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`

 For Ethereum is we repeat today ’s price % increase we will be at ATH .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is a new stable coin pegged to $ 1337 from what the last few weeks have shown us .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I feel like I am a bit too obsessed with ETH , can someone shill me on an “ ETH killer ” and why it ’s better ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I feel like the only thing I hear is “ ETH fees are expensive ” but ETH 2.0 fixes that and I do n’t see a competitor passing ETH before then with how much of a lead it has in the industry .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH IS DOING IT , ATH HERE WE GOOOO !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Fuck I was just trying to sleep and now ETH is teasing ATH how do I sleep now ? 

 !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH DID IT , NEW ATH 

 !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH looking as attractive as ever .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`! remindme 1 month “ Please tell me ETH hit $ 2k ”`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`[ EIP-1559 community call Feb. 26th](https://medium.com / ethereum - cat - herders / ethereum-1559 - community - call - d43d5f0bf909 ) 

 If you thought $ 1,800 ETH was fun , you have n’t seen anything yet .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Ex : “ I ’ll sell 1 ETH at $ 2,000 and 2 more at $ 2,500 ” or you can set stop loss orders for -30 % or something pretty hefty and just let it all ride to the moon .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Last time I slept ETH hit ATH .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I believe in crypto long term and think it ’s a great long term hold , but I watched ETH go down to $ 80 once without selling and I ’m not doing it again lol .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Can someone with terrible luck trade all of their ETH to altcoins so it can pump again please ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Out of nearly half my ETH which hurts since I think we have so much more to go ..`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH goes to like $ 2,200 but people wonder why it wo n’t go further 
 3 .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has a habit of hitting ATH after I go to sleep .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m heading to bed now , so I guess prepare to see $ 2,000 ETH . 

 ! [ gif](giphy|mguPrVJAnEHIY )`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Correct , but as someone else pointed out trading is a taxable event so swapping BTC for ETH or something is basically seen as selling .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH scaling is so damn close , I ca n’t wait .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`That means ETH ATH is just around the corner , damn , I never am holding enough ! 

 !`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Would I be able to do everything I could want in terms of learning and testing smart contracts on the test network and if so would it be easy enough to get that test networth ETH for little to nothing ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`It sounds like something I would enjoy but I ’m nervous about committing a significant amount of real ETH for learning as a hobby project .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Does anyone else feel like even nearing ATH , ETH is incredibly undervalued when considering the dev team , current tech , future prospects , brand recognition , and position in the space ?`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n’t really imagine BTC going to $ 3,500 or ETH $ 100 again .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Or you could invest in BTC / ETH and not try to time the market hoping to use Greater Fool Theory on shit coins .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`The technology , the team , the earned brand name without marketing , the roadmap , I ca n’t help but think if crypto as a whole does well Ethereum will do very well .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I just do n’t remember how much ETH only the relative fiat value of it last I checked .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Let me try : 

 BTC 89 K 

 ETH 3.8 K 

 Moons $ 0.22 

 I ’m feeling bullish , but no one ever knows in crypto ! 

 RemindMe ! 1 month`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`It was hardly a year ago 32 ETH would only cost a few thousand dollars .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`I feel it hard to imagine BTC / ETH wo n’t do well still`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`Last night before I went to bed I posted here saying ETH would likely hit ATH because I always miss it while I ’m sleeping .`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`BTC / ETH as always`
1162,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is undervalued as always .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 Conclusion - no matter how versatile eth or xrp can be , MONEY is flowing into the big daddy .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`is it just me or does anyone also feel that eth staking hype did n't live up to expectation and all staking mantra is a bit lacklustre ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 can anyone explain it a bit more , is it official eth staking ? has it fully started ? is it eth 2.0 ? 

 ( sorry for loaded comment but I feel I am behind the curve on this one .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I was expecting eth to explode with this staking news but instead it is struggling a little to be honest )`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I know these things take time but if ETH wants to be the industry leader , it needs to lay the roadmap in a clear / cut and defined manner and announce dates .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I wanted to stake 5 eth as a tester and had my eyes on ANKR or Rocketpool etc . to allow me to do that .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`it does answer many questions , while some others still remain to be answered but I guess , as you said , it is not easy to project manage an open source biggie like ETH .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 One last question , how do you see close competition catching up and going past ETH .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Of my 18 alt coin picks ( many of which were heavily shilled here).1 exit scammed , 4 were delisted , 1 faded into complete obscurity , 3 are down over 90 % , 2 are down over 80 % , 4 are down over 50 % , 2 are down just 30%1 ... is up 20%This time round I ’m sticking with ETH AND BTC 😂 xoxo  
 & gt ;  
 & gt;Repl 

 let me guess one of your coins :)) 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 ICX ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`yes , 

 ETH and BTC are being accumulated as well now ( but their gains do n't thrill me ) .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`why ? 

 ( I thought ETH is a 10 K coin in 5 years )`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`But you can see that ETH has been struggling against BTC in last few years .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`for all ladies and gents wanting the ALTS ( and ETH ) to pump , the TA shows it is itching to do just about that .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`ETH / BTC chart broken to upside with   fat green candle folks , I can see 800 for ETH incoming with a few alts rising as well .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`if nothing else works , just use the eth - grenade , it works .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Others will take years to catch up and   by that time , ETH would have had major share in DEFI and similar areas .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`AAVE , CVC , XMR , ADA , ETH , XLM , QRX , ANKR , BTC , CHSB , COTI , DOT , UTK , EGLD , ALGO 

 Thanks for being patient and reading the whole list .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`more Minerium , do n't know anything about it amte but from what I have heard so far , appears to be ETH - eating - machine .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`10x in 10 years & gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt ; 10x in 5 years now - that 's better - I think there is a place where we can meet and be friends ;) 

 when are you buying eth by the way ? ;)`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 the point is that fine with BTC / ETH safety and stability but if your risk appetite allows and you are after increasing your equity value relatively quickly , you have to take some risk in half - decent s - coins .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`[ https://prnt.sc/w4xn3x](https://prnt.sc/w4xn3x ) \- there you go ETH gang , dotted blue line is where our expectation should be at .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`buy her Ether and also include disclaimer this time ----- & gt ; " it can still go down "`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I am sure an eth bot set up can be done here as well .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I am at a point where ADA goes in my long term   hold hence it sits with btc and eth .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I think sharding mantra was used in early days when ETH was struggling with speed and ZIL needed a tag line to market themselves .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I think Coiunbase already supports that . 

 Having said that , I am not sold on the idea as they are just ETH and ZIL based projects .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,` 

 can someone illustrate how the two gas values ( for eth ) work to work out how much $ amount needs paying for any transaction ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 Listening to Ivan on Tech today , he was trying to say that ETH can be a 50k coin , any thoughts on this prediction ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`fair enough but do you think it is possible in 5/10 years time that ETH is at 50 K ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`( ideally end of 2021 ;) ) ) - so yea , ETH can be 1/10th at 22.5 K :)) getting there .............................. need another 22.5 K from somewhere LOL :)`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`i think what ETH can do is beyond many people 's imagination at this stage .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 anything limited in potential ( relatively ) - such as litecoin and xrp etc . with relatively smaller use case as compared to ETH , I do n't think we can be that bullish in our predictions for them .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`glad I am invested both in ETH and VET - I am not that good with fundamentals but will take your words for reassurance .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`look what eth baby is forming on charts , ascending triangle , break can take us to $ 800 [ https://prnt.sc/wd23nh](https://prnt.sc/wd23nh )`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH ENS is developing already , 109 coins supported - you can send money to something like * * myname.eth * * 

 crypto domains - you can receive money on something like * * myname.crypto * * web address .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`be mindful that although there is a buzz that ETH will grow faster than BTC as it has not hit its ATH yet , in reality and looking at charts recently , ETH and BTC are moving together in general .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 Some good projects on DOT include Polkastarter ( equivalent of Uniswap ) and Kusama etc . 

 watch this coin in 2021 , do n't sleep on it , it works hand in hand with ETH and helps ethereum by taking its load in parachains .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I personally think that it is very possible for BTC to stick around that number in this bull run but it also means that it will pave way for other alts such as ETH and some low caps to appreciate many times more .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 I think soon there will be a time when people will start feeling bored of bitcoin and tread into other juicy territories such as ETH and other techs .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`anyone has any experience of buying or selling ENS domains ( eth name service )`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`You seem perfect gentleman , I will buy you a pizza if ETH hits 5 K :)) thanks again .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Bitboy was saying once it breaks 1448 ATH , expect 27k per ETH by fall 2021`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`yes and a lot of what ETH 2.0 wants to do is already included in current Elrond platform so in a way they are ahead of the game .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH total coins are 115 million ( at present and assumption is that it will stay that way ) 

 ADA are 45 billion .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I strongly suggest to look at coins they offer ( they offer BTC and ETH anyway ) and if you stay within those big coins plus a few more , I suggest you start using them .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`OK folks , 1.40AM here , going to sleep , in case if ETH breaks ATH , can someone let the gorilla out for his dance .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Unless ETH pulls out a magic from somewhere , it is going to follow big daddy and go down a little folks .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I think it is a Chinese attempt to kill ETH but in my opinion , it is far from it .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`For some reason I feel that ETH will break the 1440 today ( Monday ) .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`the etherscan now shows this as my erc721 asset hence it is registered on blockchain under my ether wallet but I can still see it as PENDING on unstoppabledomains website .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's   say if I buy 1 ETH worth or erc20 token on uniswap or if I buy 10 ETH worth of same ERC20 token .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I thought you were our ETH commander ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 I think you should have picked up one from   ETH , VET , ADA or DOT .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`My gut says ETH will do better in coming months in terms of price appreciation .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`NOW ETH IS A GREAT POTENTIAL and do n't be pushed back by its large market cap , it can still surprise many because it has the biggest development .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 btc to 150 K @ 5x 

 eth to 10 K @ 10x

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 Remember - these are only predictions from someone stranger on internet .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`It is not moons issue , this is wider ETH network issue`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I am not fundamentals expert but let me tell you ETH is not to be underestimated for its potential and to be fair , development so far .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`the problem is I love ADA more than ETH`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Insufficient Funds :)) 

 joke aside , yes these fees are crazy , I think ADA is enjoying that annoyance of people from ETH 's fee .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`This bull run has come too quick for ETH , it is not ready for scaling and adoption .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`hold on , 

 I thought ETH was struggling and vaporware ADA will steal the show ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`They have a specific narrative around helping with the eth scaling and fees issue ( if I can remember correctly , have not checked recently ) .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`and I think that narrative is selling at the moment due to ETH extortionate fees .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`There is no denial , BInance is hurting ETH market at the moment .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Their founder took both ETH and BSC with criticism and said that this is about to change .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 I am just curious to know how can the same address serve two different chains ? do they not have their own format for addresses ? like bnb addresses start with bnb ... and eth addresses start with 0x .... 

 now the case is that I have one address which is serving eth , bsc and xdai chains on my metamask .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`If a token is issued on two chains ( BEP20 on binance and ERC20 on Ethereum ) , does it mean one has to remember which chain they bought the token on ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I think lots of ETH chain projects will jump onto BSC and will create BEP20 tokens as well which will create confusion for common people .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`I personally think it was over - stretched in first place . ALso with eth fees issues , I would be a bit careful but you do your research mate .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`they are saying that their solution has a fix for eth high fees .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 One example is that they recently announced partnership with ETH and mainnet version was released .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 Layer 2 is possible but I think they wo n't be massive success for ETH .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`There is a very slight hint of friction between the two factions , just because ADA is doing great at the moment does n't mean that ETH is a bad project .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 ADA and ETH can co - exist - we like both coins - we cherish the whole crypto space - long live the daddy and all its offsprings , the s - coins .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`BlueChip DEFI which is feeling some pressure due to ETH scalability and fees issue .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`can anyone confirm how much was ethereum when the smart contracts were not rolled out on ETH ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`they have announced to have their own chain separate from ETH .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Why they wrapped the xmoon and used it on eth mainnet ? does it mean what the mainnet address will change again in future when final mainnet tokens will be issued ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 It is likely that when and if Reddit officially goes on ETH ( L1 or L2 ) , it will have a different address then .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Link is an ERC20 token so ETH high fees in general is the reason .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`ok , that makes sense , but in my layman term then , does that not give an impression that ETH is and old and clunky system with lots of patches and relies on other scaling solutions as bolt ons to work properly ? 

 ( I am not bashing ETH , I love ETH and hold ETH but I am just curious to know what the real picture is going to be like )`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`then traded that 100 pounds btc for ETH but at the time of the trade , the fiat value of that trade was 200 pounds .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 in the same example , if you traded your bitcoin for $ 50 to either ETH or any other coin , that means you made a loss of $ 50 on your original price hence in your overall full year calcs , deduct this $ 50 from your gains .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`Congrats , ETH to 87k , let 's go !`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH does n't pull it quick , it will struggle , ADA and DOT are looking extremely bullish in addition to smaller players like Avalanche and Elrond or Solana etc . 

 As Charles Hoskinson said , first mover advantage can disappear , what happened to Yahoo and Alta Vista ( spell ? ) and Netscape ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 Now that it is clear that MOONs are not high worth , high reputation crypto at present , and as you are new to crypto space , you should start with solid investments such as ETH and bitcoin .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`agreed but it is hanging of a thin wire - I think one more downward push from bitcoin will break ETH to downside from its demand line .`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH , VET and ADA can make it go bonkers , why not moons ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`How do we know how many ETH he holds ?`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 Overall , I am bullish on ETH - it is a LOOOONG term HODL for me ,`
afterthefuture,favor,Ethereum,`

 Do n't get me wrong folks , we are extended on ETH so do plan for short term pull back please .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`My point is that just as there is a benefit in gas prices due to the more efficient auction mechanics , there is also a benefit to those who pay gas ( since they hold eth ) due to the new deflationary pressure .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 Of course the effects of the deflationary pressure are difficult / impossible to calculate , but for me just the psychological effect of knowing my fees are going towards increasing the value of eth vs heating up the planet with otherwise useless hashing is massive .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Growing adoption and interoperability between rollups will allow most use cases of Ethereum to have negligible fees .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 It 's important to keep in mind that neither Ethereum nor Cardano can cheat the " scalability trilemma " .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The Layer 2 approach solves this dilemma , but is technically complex and years of research are beginning to pay dividends and there 's every reason to believe why along with Ethereum 2.0 data shards will allow for 100,000 + tps without sacrificing decentralization or security .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 No other blockchain has " solved " the issues that Ethereum community is tackling right now , they are just years behind in their adoption therefore have n't faced scalability issues .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Which is why Ethereum is focusing on a Rollup - centric approach to scalability using Layer 2 .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`An individual with 100s of 32 eth validators does not gain much advantages due to economies of scale vs. individuals with a single 32 eth validator .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 I only make this distinction because you suggested stakers in Ethereum would " vote " to increase their rewards , which is not how it works .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`If you are referring to staking , there are staking pools available already ( centralized , boo ) and rocket pool is launching soon offering decentralized staking where users can deposit any amount of eth .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Fortunately , work to address this has been in progress in Ethereum for years and Layer 2 solutions are currently being deployed which let you do anything you could do on Layer 1 , but with negligible fees .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I pray that Ethereum and other blockchains can bring the world closer together .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,` 


 What Ethereum 2.0 does ( aside from PoS ) is add 64 data shards which can be used to have more capacity for L2 solutions to write their on - chain data .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The summary is that on L1 Ethereum can currently handle 7 - 12 txns per second , with all transactions on L2 1000 - 4000 tps , and L2 + 64 data shards 100,000 tps .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`This why success for Ethereum does not mean low fees , but extremely high fees on L1 due to demand to use a valuable protocol .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The devs absolutely considered these alternatives , but chose the fee burn because all evidence points to it being the best solution for the long term health of Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`But it 's up to the miners making a proposal to come up with a well researched proposal detailing why their proposed change is the best thing for Ethereum and why they have the backing of the community .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`They think they can make a " compromise " with the devs , but that is just not how Ethereum works .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`All I can say is that this 1559 issue has led me down a rabbit hole of learning about Ethereum core development and it has made me incredibly assured that the future of Ethereum is in good hands .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Crypto attracts a huge variety of people , but I 've found Ethereum dev culture to be really focused on building the best possible tech that can really bring about some transformative changes in society vs. things like bitcoin which have a huge right leaning libertarian appeal and a much smaller imagination about what is possible :)`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,` 


 The long answer is that Ethereum derives its value from its dapps and dapp users / devs .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm confused that you both understand L2 solutions are being slowly deployed to address the fee issue , but think that fees harm the bull case for Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`There is nothing flawed about Ethereum that is leading to high fees , it 's just the first smart contract blockchain to get actual people using actual applications at any kind of scale .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum has a scaling plan which has many different parts in order to achieve low fees without giving up decentralization .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`In both cases , devs and Ethereum community would make every effort to respond to this threat , primarily by rushing PoS merge .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The question for the Ethereum community is whether 1559 improves the protocol long term .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The value proposition of Ethereum is not that ETH will serve primarily as a currency , but more as digital oil which fuels a thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`You are correct that the current validators on the beacon chain are earning ETH that can not be sold on the market ( for now ) .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`However , this has n't stopped ETH holders who believe in Ethereum development efforts from locking up their ETH in the Eth2 deposit contract to the tune of more than $ 5,641,593,080.13 .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`This point would need a lot of data - driven analysis to show that such an attack would be economically feasible and profitable for the attacker before committing the Ethereum network from paying higher and higher amounts for security .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`There 's a reason Ethereum 2.0 research phase lasted so long , because the commitment to creating a PoS system which is as decentralized as possible took a lot of effort and even incorporated cutting edge cryptographic techniques such as BLS signatures .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Note that anyone can be a node operator in Rocketpool , but they need to provide 16 out of the total 32 ETH in order to be economically aligned with the interests of the staking " customers " .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`If you are suggesting Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum are centralized , you have n't done the research .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`They will be moving to a Layer 2 roll - up , which preserves all of the benefitial properties of regular Layer 1 Ethereum ( trustless , secure , decentralized ) , but with negligible fees due to the cutting edge application of amazkng cryptographic techniques .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`This is exactly how all these other platforms claim to have beaten Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum founders and development community are unwaveringly committed to making nodes usable on consumer hardware .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Luckily years of research is finally coming to fruition which can scale Ethereum from 7 - 12 tps to 100,000 tps without giving up on any of the qualities that made it desirable in the first place .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has 80,000 plus validators ( and growing ) and a community of users and apllications which dwarfs all other smart contract blockchains combined many times over .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum solves the scaling trilemma by taking advantage of Layer 2 solutions .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Luckily the development and deployment of Layer 2 solution on Ethereum is light years ahead of any other ecosystem , with already solutions in production breaking records of usage every day and many more in various stages of development .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`This is not an easy to answer question as people will inevitably have different values , but let me give you the perspective of Ethereum developers and community : Ethereum should be as decentralized as possible while still allowing for worldwide adoption .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum is in the process of fulfilling that goal , with years of research and implementation to prove that it 's possible to have 100,000 + tps without sacrificing decentralization .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 If Ethereum developers believed 15 tps was the limit of what is possible , the project would have been abandoned years ago .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I agree that 1559 redirects money currently going to miners to ETH holders ( though that is a side effect , not the main purpose ) .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Miners get paid in ETH , so their ETH will also benefit from the burn as much as anyone else .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 I find no risk of Ethereum being overtaken any time soon given the headstart they have in terms of building an enormous ecosystem of applications , developers , and users .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 It 's evidently clear that the vast majority of interest in " ethkillers " is driven by a desire to get in early on the next Bitcoin more than it is based on a real desire to build the massive ecosystem which exists in Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`But I just wish these people would realize that Ethereum is not just the next Bitcoin , but something much more important in the long term and we 're still incredibly early .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Seems you do n't believe the Ethereum devs can fulfill the development road map and there have definitely been delays which have been frustrating , but most of those delays are because improvements to the spec were made , not because of a lack of trying .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I agree with most of what you are saying , the network is indeed limited by the slowest nodes and Ethereum does have a commitment to make the slowest node quite slow .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 In the case of Ethereum , the plan which is being rolled out is that through a combination of sharding and Rollups , the network can scale to levels enough to meet any kind of demand including worldwide adoption without sacrificing decentralization or security .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`This approach is * much * harder than the approaches of its purported competitors and I understand some people do n't believe it can happen , but having been following Ethereum development for years , it absolutely is happening .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 I think this outcome is technically possible , but given the state of Ethereum ecosystem and the state of its competitors , I do n't see any projects with a valuation which reflects their probability of actually succeeding in this .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 This means to me Ethereum has the more thriving ecosystem and the better design for the long term .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`And I do n't think it 's likely for that ecosystem to be recreated by the competition before the L2 ecosystem in Ethereum starts exploding .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`But to put it succintly , yes , many believe that Ethereum can " do it all " .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`For another angle on this , for Ethereum with PoS on the horizon to choose a technically inferior option because of threat of miner revolt would seriously shake confidence in the network .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Transferring these costs about twice as much as transferring ETH itself .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The hard part is acquiring dev mindshare , dev tooling , onboarding materials , designing crypto - economics systems , performing audits , building governance systems , building communities , designing inter - interoperability standards , contracts being battle - tested by years of production use , etc . 

 It is in these areas that Ethereum has a huge head - start of many years vs. its so - called competitors .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 Tons of stats about the beaconchain here : [ https://beaconcha.in/](https://beaconcha.in/ )  


 The plan is to let the beaconchain run for \~1 year before merging the two chains and phasing out PoS. This time is mostly to observe the beaconchain and make sure there are no issues before entrusting it with the security of Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Which is why it took Ethereum developers many years of research to come up with the design that today has 90,000 + validators , whereas PoS systems like Cardano can not handle more than \~1000 .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I believe myself to be some flavor of " Ethereum maximalist " but because I do believe the technology is superior .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 These attacks would not be good for the price of ETH ( to out it mildly ) , which is what miners receive as payment , making it a dubious plan .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 In contrast , I thing Ethereum has an existing and growing ecosystem of dapps which are being used because people find them useful / lucrative .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,` 


 I think this is just an inescapable consequence of Ethereum existing within a Capitalist world system .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`And I am not so naive as to think that Ethereum represents any kind of break from Capitalism .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Check out this page to see how rewards change based on how much ETH is staked : [ https://launchpad.ethereum.org/](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/ )`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 The purpose of launching the beacon chain well in advance of the merge ( 12 - 18 months away ) is to make sure it behaves as expected without any issues before entrusting it with securing Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Especially considering ETH which is staked now is completely unusable until the merge , so there needs to be an incentive to get real users on the beacon chain .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 This is all to say that I expect ETH to be deflationary as soon as 1559 is implemented and moving forward into the long term as well .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Given the price difference between ETH and ETC , it 's clear which one maintained community support .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is committed to having consumer hardware capable of running nodes .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Therefore having a deflationary ETH provides increased security in PoS without meaningfully dissuading usage in gas fees .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The beauty of Ethereum is it provides a platform for an entire ecosystem of currencies so individuals get the choice of which to use .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 A key point in all this is that ETH must be very valuable for PoS to be able to secure a large ecosystem of useful applications .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`In practice I am saying that is not the case , it is implemented by the various Ethereum clients at the protocol level .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`Others like myself think Ethereum will win out over bitcoin in the long term .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 A big part of the reason I think ETH will be a better store of value over the long term is Proof of Stake .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 I understand your point about not antagonizing miners but that is not a good reason to delay improvements to Ethereum that have been long anticipated by the community .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`How exactly are miners going to push the base fee up without burning massive amounts of their own ETH ?`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`If they want to inflate the base fee by burning massive amounts of their own ETH , they are free to do so , but this is not sustainable .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you had an opportuny to get 5 % APY in dollars and 3 % APY in ETH ( assuming same risk ) , even if you thought ETH would 10x in the long term you would still go for the dollar yield and just buy Eth with your dollars .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`If you want to stake more , you can do so with 64 ETH by running two validators .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`

 If this proposal made Ethereum better , " investors " would support it , but changing issuance on a whim would be extremely damaging to trust in Ethereum governance .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`After 1559 is is live in July , everyone who holds ETH benefits from fees being burnt .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`If they do these things then they are users like anyone else and share the same interest in seeing Ethereum succeed long term .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`At this stage of its development , with transition to PoS long overdue , mining is seen as a necessary evil to pay for security until PoS where security will be higher for much lower cost to Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I believe most miners in Ethereum also believe in it long term , but things have gotten adversarial recently because a small group of loud miners have created an " us vs. them " narrative that is completely counter - productive and based on a flawed understanding of what mining * is * in PoW systems .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`There is no Eth1 vs. Eth2 , there is only Ethereum .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm sure there will be a group that creates a PoW fork at that point , but it wo n't get the support of the Ethereum developers or the greater Ethereum ecosystem .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`I would hope that people making mining investments do the bare minimum to understand the Ethereum roadmap .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`The point of Optimism is that it 's a Layer2 solution with the ability to run Ethereum smart contracts basically without changes .`
defewit,favor,Ethereum,`It exists to prevent a malicious contracts from draining a ton of ETH , but when you are doing basic transfers or interacting with trusted contracts , a predictable amount of gas is used leading to the behavior you saw .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`That 's what makes networks like Ethereum so valuable is that multiple different assets of all kinds can be exchanged .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`There 's a reason why everything gets built on Ethereum , and that 's because each new dapp uses common contract infrastructure , so they build network effects around each other .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Then BTC and ETH bleed a bit , XRP catches up to ETH in mcap , then ETH explodes , and then BTC starts going up , and the cycle starts all over`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`That means that I need to send my BTC/ ETH to an exchange to convert it to Nano .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I personally believe we 're still far away from this goal , but that 's why Ether is also such an attractive value play long - term .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`If you think there 's a chance long - term that Ethereum and DeFi ( open access financial markets ) will become more ingrained in society , then Ether becomes a worthwhile value investment .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Arguably , ETH is a better store of value than BTC , the market just has n't realized that yet .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Not being on Ethereum is like launching a website that s not on the internet`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I like Monero and I hope they find a way to bridge it to Ethereum in a decentralized way .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you think ETH is going to 5k , then staking today can be incredibly profitable in the future .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`It 's a little different now because Ethereum is becoming useful , so it 's not only speculation .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Explain to me why Ethereum will never have better privacy than Monero`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`But seriously , Ethereum is n't a payment service like Visa or PayPal , it 's a financial contract platform .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`You can always cancel a transaction by sending a 0 eth transaction to yourself .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`So yes , Ethereum has made a choice to have less tx / s in favor of more decentralization .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`And yes , users will also be able to pool their ETH , that 's what 's so great about it .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Also , I disagree that the 32 ETH is a barrier to participation .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 That 's another thing , the ETH distribution from its initial PoW stage means it 's one of , if not the most distributed asset in crypto .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has by far the most developer activity , like it 's not even close , so I have no idea where you 're pulling your metrics .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have predictable supply inflation due to PoW. The difference is that the Ethereum community recognizes that issuance is important for a multitude of reasons , including security , which is why the philosophy is to issue the minimum amount required to maintain adequate security .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I think Ethereum users will be fine on the privacy side .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Also , most Ethereum users do n't deposit on centralized exchanges , we use stuff like Uniswap .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Ether allows things like DAI to exist .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I have yet to hear a compelling reason why BTC is needed at all , assuming that ETH has stable issuance and is fully transitioned to ETH2`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm a fan of FDIC insured stablecoins on Ethereum where the issuers can prove they have reserves and holders have some insurance .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`What will likely happen is that the layer 1 protocols that want to participate in DeFi will absolutely need to build bridges to Ethereum , which means that Aave and Comp liquidity will freely flow outwards .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think any lending protocols on Ethereum need to focus specifically on interoperability , because other protocols will do that for them .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Decentralized exchanges and zero knowledge protocols on Ethereum will make banning privacy coins futile .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH and BTC are banned , then that means governments are taking the authoritarian response .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 Also current ETH and 2.0 ETH are the same , so not sure what you mean .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`The tokens live on Ethereum , which means you can swap any of them using Uniswap , which is just a contract .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin responsible for what ? 

 Also , no , ETH is a decentralized asset and ETH 2 is a decentralized protocol , there 's no common enterprise here , and the yields are in ETH , not USD .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`In order to ban people from using Ethereum and buying ETH , you 'd also have to ban Bitcoin .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`The context of this comment chain is that I 'm saying if ETH were banned , you would also need to ban BTC in order to effectively stop people from entering the Ethereum ecosystem .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Problem is , that ETH might keep running , and then the bear market low could be 1k .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone saying Ethereum Phase 0 is just " people putting coins into a contract " is either stupid , or being deliberately deceptive , especially considering it seems like this guy shills Cardano , which does n't even have smart contracts .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`There are no other dapps in the world that can do what the dapps on Ethereum can do , and you 're surprised people are paying fees to use it ?`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`There 's huge demand to lock ETH up as collateral in DeFi and for staking , the same or more than the ICOs .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Not to mention that ETH is one of the most traded pairs for alts .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Every coin is trying to be like Ethereum , I wonder why .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`See , i think it 's BTC / ETH / DOT or ATOM .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 You 've got the first mover BTC and its huge network effects , you have Ethereum which is basically the smart money layer of crypto , and then you have Polkadot or Cosmos where you can have blockchain specific dapps or enterprise / businesses who build their own semi - decentralized networks and plug into Ethereum .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I believe the ETH / BTC ratio should be much higher than it is today for several reasons .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`It 's just obvious to me Ethereum is king .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Inflation rate on Ethereum today is not much higher than Bitcoin and offset by staking .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 Cosmos was the first , like Ethereum was the first .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Stargate / IBC means the Cosmos Hub will become the Uniswap of Tendermint / Cosmos SDK chains with Ethereum interoperaility , which means it 'll be the first operational interblockchain protocol over 6 years in the making .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`The closest one to having a thriving DeFi ecosystem like Ethereum is Cosmos .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`That 's exactly what I said in 2016 when ETH was $ 7 .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`You could swap it for ETH and send it to tornado.cash and have it mixed .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`On February 18th , the Cosmos Hub is upgrading to Stargate which will implement the IBC ( jnterblockchain communication ) protocol which will allow all of these other chains as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum and others to send value to each other through the Hub .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Uhh , there 's like more than 30 different layer 2 networks being built on Ethereum , and already a lot of them have already been released .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`It 's just people that missed out on gains from BTC and ETH and think ADA is cheap or something .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`This is where the alternative DeFi ecosystem happens outside of Ethereum , but everyones distracted with Cardano and Polkadot .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Well their network is down right now https://explorer.avax.network/. but I 'm sure it 's just a hiccup , and they 'll go right back to killin ' Ethereum !`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Owning SCRT and not ATOM is kinda like owning UNI and not ETH .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`The nodes that validate Ethereum and Bitcoin not only get mining rewards through minting coins into existence , but they also get transaction fees .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Perhaps people should take the time to understand why Ethereum has high gas fees .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`If you do n't mind waiting , then in a couple years , the experience of using Ethereum will be simpler and cheaper than any alternative .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I mean , I think this is incredibly bullish for Ethereum , after all , the EVM is becoming totally entrenched .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Why would gas fees prevent the price from going up if Ethereum the network is in high demand ?`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 In 2017 people used to say Ethereum is useless and has no use cases .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`These are systems that will hold trillions of dollars of real world assets , it pays to have a highly secure base layer for asset settlement like Ethereum , but scaling will come , and in many cases is already here .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum regularly hard forks to include EIPs ( Ethereum Improvement Proposals ) that the community thinks should be included .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Otherwise , it 's just small improvements to the base layer that conitnues to make ETH 1.0 a little bit better .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Well people bitch about gas fees on Ethereum and then say Cardano will be cheaper and better .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`It 's pretty clear that guy only cares about Ethereum and not himself at all .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 I concede that I could invest in ADA as a hedge in case I 'm wrong , but I already have a hedge with ATOM because I believe the Cosmos ecosystem is not a competitor to Ethereum , but rather very complimentary ( see Terra and Mirror , or the Secret Network ) 

 All that to say , I do n't have any ADA and I do n't plan on buying some anytime soon .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Then everyone bitches about not having enough ETH .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I know that Ether is treated as foreign property ( where I am ) and Ethereum fees are paid in ETH so there 's capital losses and gains here .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Also , I believe investing in people early on is incredibly important , that 's why I invested in TSLA early on too because of Elon , but I digress , With Ethereum , even as early as 2016 ,   I was using smart contracts and trying out solidity from day one , and I guess I always disagreed on Cardanos approach to make provable code and to take the slow methodical approach .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`We 've actually seen this play out with Ethereum , where a lot of the exploits use the contracts exactly as written , and typically contracts exploits take the form of oracle price feed mispricing or liquidity exploits from use cases like flash loans that impose an attack vector previously unrecognized ( unknown unknown ) .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`

 Some things about Casper FFG , it is permisionless , in the sense that any node can join in and out thanks to slashing mechanisms , so anyone with the some amount of ETH can join the network and validate and list of " permissioned " nodes ( like in Cosmos ) is n't required so it lends to a substantial amount of decentralization , as the node code is on the order of hundreds of thousands .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`To address your point , while 32 ETH is required to validate , smart contracts allow validating nodes to be tokenized and thus protocols can be built such that they allow people to pool their ETH .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`If you did , you 'd know that they have a limited throughput just like Ethereum .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`The only way to get low fees and maintain decentralization is through layer 2 scaling 

 Ethereum is already scaling today , with xDai , Matic , Loopring , Starkware and Optimism to name a few .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`And Connext is the layer 2 interoperability protocol that allows users to jump from layer 2 to layer 2 . 

 None of these other platforms are even close to what Ethereum has achieved , and that 's in large part because all of the worlds best crypto developer 's are developing layer 2s on Ethereum .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`That 's a big difference is that Ethereum is so decentralized and distributed that anyone that wants to scale Ethereum can do so .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum developers have litterally been working on scaling solutions for 3 years now , and all of that hard work is hitting mainnet throughout this year .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Actually , the good airdrops come from using dapps on Ethereum .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Great , now do this for a layer 2 on Ethereum with stablecoins and then you 'll have a real payment network interoperable with the biggest decentralized network in crypto without the need for another coin .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`They think that the gains in BTC and ETH are over so they look elsewhere , There 's a chance you can find a coin that will go up longterm on the ratios , but your odds are much less than if you just bought BTC or ETH .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure what nonsense you 're spouting but Polkadot uses GRANDPA which is a GHOST based algorithm for its chaintip selection algorithm ( GHOST is based on Casper / Ethereum ) and it uses a fork from Tendermint for its consensus ( reference 5.1 https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf ) , and then uses the standard VDF for on chain randomness .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`There 's 30B in locked value in Ethereum defi , and you say it maybe has some adoption ?`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Saying Ethereum partnered with anyone is nonsensical since Ethereum is n't an entity .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Using zk starks today is complicated , it requires a sound understanding of not only Ethereum and Layer 2 , but also of cryptography itself .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`If Matic builds an optimistic roll up and allows people to gain Ethereum security and self custody while using their version of an OVM , then they will be successful , but they will need to pivot to STARKs in the longterm .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Because it seems like there 's a lot of confused noobs that think they should be using BTC and ETH to buy hot dogs .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`You should not be using ETH to buy stuff at retailers , you should be using a stablecoin , preferably on a layer 2 payment system ( like Loopring ) .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I would argue that a EVM compatible layer 2 on Ethereum could be a great breeding ground for a decentralized Uber / AirBNB .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Buying LUNA and not ATOM is like buying MKR and not ETH .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Well , considering Aave has no future without Ethereum , I would say you 're probably right .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine that Ethereum is like the internet , and Aave is like a company built on the internet .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah , let 's hold a literal shitcoin in hopes it does 40 % once a year and then bleeds on the BTC and ETH ratio otherwise .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`ETH issuance is not 15 % , it 's closer to 4 % .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I think you 're more likely to succeed if you focus on the ' providing resources ' part and outsource your security to a chain that 's built for it , like Ethereum .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`I eventually bought some ETH , but I have zero regrets about not buying " early " because I never really got involved for money .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`If you go read the Ethereum announcement thread in the BitcoinTalk forums back in 2014 , this was actually a concern brought up on like page 1 or 2 . 

 The truth is , in order to be able to do this , you need several key pieces of infrastructure that have n't really been possible until this year .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`For example , zk.money is a layer 2 on Ethereum that uses zero knowledge proofs to wrap DAI into zkDAI ( this provides privacy on stablecoin transactions with the L2 ) .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`There are always ways of using that staked ether in Ethereum since it 's locked in the contract .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`It just requires social consensus around how you use that ether , like we have today with the Beacon Chain .`
BuyETHorDAI,favor,Ethereum,`At some point , a group of people will launch a system that everyone agrees is a proof of stake chain using that ether .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I know this is a ridiculous question - what are people 's predictions for ETH Peak price this Run`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Very true & amp ; I suppose we wo n't see the full capabilities of ETH until BTC properly slows down for the rest to catch it up .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Honestly , 

 I would recommend doing your own research , like proper research on what Coins have good usability and I found my luck changed a lot when I made the switch to having the majority of my Portfolio in ETH or BTC , then used the less % of my portfolio to be made up of ALT Coins , equally , only ever invest what you can afford to be without at this moment in time or the future as there is a lot of risk involved .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Come on ETH let 's keep going !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`come on eth ! woke up in England to it flying !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Would it be a good idea to move some ALT 's into ETH & amp ; then back to ALT 's if ETH hits ATH ?`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Wondering whether i should trade 1/3 of my ADA for ETH today ?`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Taking a break from Crypto today , let 's hope we see an ATH for ETH .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Always asleep for when it bottoms , so annoying , Still bought some more ETH`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Looking for some more ALT 's to invest in : 

 Current Portfolio is ETH , ADA , LINK , VET .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I need a thread like this , I have a bit of ETH spare that if i sold would cover a large amount of my initial investment due to how the prices have rocketed since i first invested , my biggest fear is doing so and then having ETH fly to say wayyy above it 's ATH`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I agree , personally my two favourite currencies are ETH & amp ; ADA , joined the ETH train at about £ 290 , big fan of VET too .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ADA / ETH / LINK let 's moveeeeee`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Do n't mind if it bounces back below it , just want to be part of ETH hitting ATH .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm in profit , but do wish i had placed more money into ETH & amp ; BTC at an earlier stage .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`This is solid advice , I did n't invest enough in BTC / ETH from the beginning and invested a lot in ALTS , the alt 's have performed and I am in profit , i do think primarily though , new people should accumulate some BTC / ETH & amp ; Then collect small amounts of ALT 'S as we go .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`That 's good , I rate that , i do wonder whether I am best to keep the BNB or move it to ADA , BTC or ETH`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Question guys , genuinely does anyone think there is any coins out there that have the sort of potential ETH had , to go from $ 2 to $ 1400 .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I thought so , ETH really has laid the foundation for future coins to even be possible`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`£ 900 for ETH Compared to where we was a couple of months ago is crazy .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Honestly , one of my pals was telling the rest of us what a scam Crypto was and then when we doubled our investment and then some he invested on ETH at £ 900 and then bought EWT .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH 🚀 🚀`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Nice , i also had DOT but doubled profit and moved it into ETH when ETH was around £ 250 so it has been a good investment really but still like the project so was hoping it would drop !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH is my favourite , but ADA is up there for me .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Tbf i do plan on topping up the ETH !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I hold a small amount of BTC but have debated moving that over to ETH as i feel i may have missed the boat on this one .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Thinking LONG term here , does anyone feel that ETH will flip BTC value wise ?`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`i see ETH reaching 10k but not sure what happens beyond there`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I really do believe in ETH , I think it is so fundamental to the rest of the crypto system ..`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Portfolio is currently made up of : 

 ADA , ETH , LINK , VET , UNIL , 1INCH , ZIL .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I like what I ’m seeing : 

 ETH & amp ; ADA 🚀`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`So happy about ETH pushing it !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETH promising both short & amp ; long term .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's be honest .. we all love ETH`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Do I FOMO into more ETH / Link or HODL till the prices correct a bit ( NOT SURE THEY ARE GOING TO )`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Go on Metamask , get the ETH ( Gas fee included ) open up Zerion .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I am saying that the ETH 2.0 Needs to make them cheaper`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I love ETH , do you see it as too expensive to buy into rn ?`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I love ETH , plan on keeping it for a long time !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Question , this is my first bull run and in - turn means the bear run will be my first too .. 

 With all the money being pumped in by institutions and businesses , will we see a bear market like we did previously with ETH @`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`If my GRT was a coinbase earn freebie , and is now worth £ 45 - 50 , do I ride the wave here or move that small chunk or change into ETH .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Nice man , I saw your post so pondered the Q myself , £ 50 extra ETH is always appealing hahahaha`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Still makes me happy seeing ETH over £ 1,300`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`If you ’ve got UNI & amp ; ETH already it ’s definitely worth picking up some Link mate , I hodl all 3 !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`It 's tough really to pick what to do with it , I have a small bag that i 've accumulated through Coinbase earn tasks ( I moved all the other coinbase earn 's into GRT ) 

 Was debating moving the rest of that bag into ETH .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I love you still ETH , do n't forget it .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is great & amp ; if they can sort out ETH 2.0 and fees then you ’ll be happy with your purchase`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I REALLY hope eth 2.0 does sort them issues out`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`So am i right in thinking that 

 My SORA is in the metmask wallet , 

 VAL Tokens will be deposited there , and then to do anything with them i 'll need to deposit my ETH ?`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I got most of my zil for 4p & amp ; 5p & amp ; my ETH For £ 290 so for me the prices seem high !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Tempted to stick the FIAT into ETH & amp ; wait and see what happens then`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I do love ETH , most of my spare FIAT at the end of the month goes into topping it up , If they fix the Gas fee 's and the other issues then the sky is the limit for it .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETH : Come on boy you want to break free and rocket , we all know it`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`guess i am waiting for the ETH gas fee 's to lower`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Binance is by far the best exchange in my opinion & amp ; with that said with their ability to produce cheap fee 's on their smart system , it 's not hard to see why it has grown so much , I do n't see it staying this way long term if ETH 2.0 produces what everyone is after , people will move back to UNISWAP & amp ; 1INCH , but for now , especially for new people looking to escape mass fee 's BNB and its system is the way forward , I am more of an ETH Man myself i must say .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I feel that they have made an excellent platform that works for both beginners & amp ; experienced traders , alright their DEFi system that is really not decentralised is n’t quite correct & amp ; the way they have suspended ETH withdrawals is poor , but they offer a great exchange & amp ; BNB Being in the top 3 is n’t forever , this is due to the fact that ETH fees are so high , Binance ca n’t be solely blamed for the influx of people coming their way .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I bought an XOR Token the other day and paid close to $ 40 in fee 's , it left me just short to buy more so I had to send more ETH to complete the purchase hahaha`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Really having to force myself not to move my Inch into ZIL / LINK / ETH , someone tell me not to , otherwise it 's gon na happen ..`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETHEREUM / LINK / UNI / VET / ZIL /ADA 

 Most of these get shilled in here daily mate when it 's pumping , Zil offers good staking , Link is introducing staking later this year , VET is chinese so some love and some hate , ADA is somewhat called a new ETH although i hold i 'm not convinced and ETH is ETH`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I got some LINK & amp ; ETH today , got ZIL yesterday although it did just keep dropping haha`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I switched my INCH into ETH before it tumbled to £ 2.80 something yesterday , quite happy i did !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Interesting mate , see i 'm in a bit of a predicament , i 'm quite high on ETH and therefore 30 % of my portfolio is ETH , tempted to sell my moons and buy some BTC with the Fiat from it .. although I also worry that that is a big mistake haha`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETH sitting nice & amp ; pretty , an ATH by end of the week would be good`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Suppose I need to have a lot to cover ETH fees haha`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I like this , I see a lot of people complain when people are all in on ALT 's , but personally I think if the majority of the ALT 'S are ETH and you have no BTC then you are still safe`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`

 5 % DOT into ETH 

 Still not sure i 'd move any DOT though , I think it 's a coin that 's here to stay .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Wondering why we are all holding the moons each month instead of selling a portion of them to get a bigger bag of ETH / ZIL ? ? ?`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I keep debating whether to sell mine or not to get some more ETH , but imagine they do rocket up & amp ; we ’ve missed out on a potential moonshot !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I think all of the ETH killers have 0 chance of actually killing ETH , people are still sticking with it despite the high fee ’s atm .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`If you are going to convert it , great , but when doing so you really should wait until ETH settles down a bit , otherwise you are converting at a bad rate , usually is a sunday sell off in here , i 'd wait till then personally`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I hold ETH , not worth staking it in my personal opinion , LINK is introducing staking very soon !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETH could keep moving sideways & amp ; I ’d still believe in it`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Went for a run & amp ; BTC / ETH are flying .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s push ETH to ATH too ! !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Would love to see ETH hit £ 1500`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I did say we are going to ETH ATH this week`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`LET 'S GET ETH TO ATH !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`i hold ETH regardless of it 's stagnant price lately , i genuinely think once they sort out the issues associated with it , that it is going to be even better than it is !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I sold at the time to buy ETH @ 290 , so I suppose in a weird way I am better off`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I need some sleep , I trust you lot to push ETH over the line whilst I sleep .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I reckon by tomorrow ETH will be there 🚀`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`KEEP GOING ETH , LET 'S SMASH £ 1500`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETH gon na make us rich team`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is making me proud`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`My prediction for ETH ATH was right this week .. what do you want me to predict next ?`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s got to £ 580 quicker than ETH got me from £ 290 to 1K. Just find it crazy that it ’s not on any exchanges currently`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Just think it ’s always safer to buy into BTC as well as your ETH / LINK etc , just because BTC seems to have so much power over the market , when it goes down the market tends to follow`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Holding ETH / LINK / UNI VET / ZIL feel 's good rn`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;more I learn about ETH the more I think it should be 80 % of my portfolio instead of the 35 % it is now .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Keep going ETH , you know you should ! !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Getting my car serviced today , i 've prepared for worst case , if there is any spare fiat you can guarantee it 's getting lumped into eth`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Yes , love to see ETH moving`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`LET 'S GO ETH`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s get ETH over the line`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`I am a simple man , I love ETH`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Here to say that ETH is great .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Haha nice ! 

 Mine are : 

 ETH , BTC , ZIL , LINK , ADA , VET , RSR , EWT , BAT , XOR , VAL , UNI , DOT ( hope I have n’t missed any )`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`Seeing stuff like this is the reason I wo n't sell my ETH , i paid £ 290 for it , i have a goal in my mind that if it reaches i 'll sell , but why stop for less than potentially life changing money .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`[ https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5qs0q/how\_many\_times\_can\_one\_person\_possibly\_miss\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5qs0q/how_many_times_can_one_person_possibly_miss_out/ ) 

 This is why I wo n't sell my ETH , I paid £ 290 for it , why sell for a £ 3k profit , i 'm holding in the hope that ETH is life changing !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`There was a nice solid 6 - 0 defeat for us in grim windy conditions , had better days haha ! 

 Let ’s keep pushing ETH ! !`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`It 's incredible is n't it , I got into ETH when it was at £ 290 somehow`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`

 An example for me is that i 'm not willing to move some of my ETH on metamask due to the fee 's .`
Samgeorge484,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;t $ 2800 I told a guy waiting for an ETH dip to get in 

 If it does , we buy more .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Guesses on when ETH hits $ 1k USD ?`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH ! ! ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m sure a lot of folks plan on keeping ETH long term around here .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I think you may fomo in when ETH breaks through $ 700`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Got paid today , and deposited 60 % of my cheque into crypto about to buy more ETH .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n’t be the only one who gets hard seeing ETH still so undervalued .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH ! ! ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`ETH baby let ’s go ! ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`That or BTC but I think ETH provides the highest gains if you enter with Fiat .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Remember ETH is not even 50 % of its ATH yet .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m glad it ’s dipping , I ’m able to continue DCA - ing and accumulating more ETH and XMR .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I hope you guys have been scooping up as much ETH as you can during the dip .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Take a 🌚 for swapping to ETH !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`With alts bleeding further , it ’s a good way to start DCA - ing your way into the market to buy coins like Ethereum and stack the bags higher before they take off next year .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`More and more ETH being locked into staking , very exciting ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH ! ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I have no regrets at all DCA - ing fiat into Monero and Ethereum as the ATHs have still a ways to go and strongly believe they will smash through them next year .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`ETH baby let ’s go ! ! ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Who thinks ETH cracks $ 700 by the New Year ?`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Who else believes ETH breaks ATH in 2021 ?`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`And with the move to PoS and the ether lockup growing , futures being added to ETH by CME group , it ’s just a matter of time for it to explode 🚀`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s gooo ETH ! !`

jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`ETH above $ 2k is a much better sight to see than back in the 1.9k zone .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`You would just need to select whether you ’re trading erc-20 based tokens ( which would show on metamask Ethereum mainnet chain ) or bep-20 based tokens ( which would show on metamask Binance smart chain ) .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t let grayscale get your discounted ETH !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t let grayscale get your discounted ETH !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Wonder what the look of the ETH 2.0 validators is like seeing this bloodshed lol .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH testnet which is what moons currently run on ( until we move to mainnet ) .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Make us proud ETH soldiers . !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I ’ve been buying ETH at every golden opportunity I could and I ’m addicted to stacking it up 😍 give me rocketpool soon baby !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`ETH soldiers report for duty , next stop the moon on moonday .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I got my ETH , VET , and some ADA that I ’ll be all staking and accumulating for a few years and see where they head .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH smash that ATH ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`If you ’re bullish on the long term prospects of ETH ( I think a lot of us are lol ) , staking is almost a given for those passive rewards !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Do note that BETH will have a 1:1 correlation swap back to ETH once 2.0 is completed .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Give us that decentralized ETH staking from our ledgers ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s not centralized , so anyone with ETH should be able to stake !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I believe you ’ll need to wait for rocketpool decentralized ETH staking once mainnet is launched sometime summer ( afaik ) .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`If I find any info on ETH staking for New Yorkers before rocketpool launches , I ’ll let you know .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`In ETH for the long haul , and I ’m sure many others around here are too !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go ETH get past 2.7k today ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`As of right now , for anything sub 32 ETH , you ll have to go through a centralized exchange such as coinbase or Binance .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Although once rocketpool hits mainnet , you should be able to participate and stake in decentralized ETH staking ( 32 ETH limit does n’t exist so even people with 1 ETH for example can stake once rocketpool is on the mainnet sometime this summer ) .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Excited to see Uni V3 coming out early May .. could be the catalyst that sends ETH to new price discovery levels .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I agree , it ’s a risk people have to take if they want to be able to hop on the staking train now before rewards get further reduced by the time the decentralized ETH staking gets released .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`ETH and UNI making me proud`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Who ’s ready for 2.8k ETH to be smashed next ! ! !`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`ETH standing strong with grandpa Bitcorn acting up again`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`ETH and VET know how to make a lad happy .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I honestly believe this summer , specifically once EIP 1559 goes into full gear , we ’ll see a massive pump in ETH and the DeFi assets that run on the Ethereum blockchain .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`Seeing ETH above that $ 3000 barrier makes me very happy .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`VET and ETH got my portfolio looking extra juicy`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I hope some of you have started staking a portion of your ETH in coinbase or Binance while waiting for rocketpool this summer .`
jkopas,favor,Ethereum,`I already shat my pants each $ 100 ETH goes up`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`With ETH   2.0 staking on Rocketpool , is there any benefit in staking now or wait while it becomes a bit more mainstream / noob friendly ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 I 've already got the mindset of having 32 eth and running a node , so the eth is locked up .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`People are gon na want to fomo into staking eth 2 , even those who have n't a clue what to do .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Price pressure on eth will see it pass $ 600 end of week .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is on Meth 

 XRP is on P 

 BCH is on Helium 

 And the rest of it .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Its like the rally of 2017 when ICO 's had investors buying their shitcoins with ETH .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH is effectively under the control of the exchange and this is the case for any exchange staking ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum will do what Satoshi wanted bitcoin to do with extras .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`With 1.2 million ETH locked up now in the ETH2 deposit contract , you got to think what s going to happen to the ETH price as these 1.2 m are now effectively out of circulation .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Makes sense Vitalik founded Ethereum .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Its so severely undervalued I 'm betting we have a parabolic epiphany on a mass scale and when instos are done buying up bitcoins they 'll clamor for all the ETH . 0.25 is my benchmark figure .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Yes good to see ETH take the baton from BTC .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Basically what happened over night   was bitcoin got a little tired and passed the baton on to ETH .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`BTC still at 27k and ETH needs to show what it can do .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Its good to see the instos buying into chunks of ETH , and do nt forget we have 2 million locked up in the ETH 2.0 contract not to be touched for at least 2 years .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 My crypto purchasing power is heavily ETH weighted with the remaining going equally to btc and ltc .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`If its not BTC making your face cramp up with smiles its ETH .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Easily rectified by converting fiat to the triple A of crypto BTC & amp ; ETH .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Its funny to think LTC is at a price that ETH was earlier this year .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I can see ETH ATH hitting this month .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Hot damn ETH took up the baton from BTC and said let me show you how its done bitch .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`No , way sooner bangagangrang you see Vitalik will quadruple his ETH efforts when he gets a taste of my sweet tight as a drum ass .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`That s right one stimulus check back in April can only buy you 1 ETH today .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I see it catching up this year , if BTC hits 100k ETH will be around the 10k mark .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Is this the same with Ethereum , not just Grayscale but other insto 's too ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Just could n't let ETH have this one .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`There has n't been enough ETH posts in the daily so thought I 'd add this .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm kinda mirroring it , well if you can call it that I 've been holding for 3 years with the main 3 coins BTC , ETH , LTC so they 're kinda mirroring me .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 For anyone new I 'd go BTC 40 % ETH 40 % and 20 % choice of what you research .`

TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`April I swear I 'll get a ETH is 1337 tattoo on my ass .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm wondering if he 's had any musings over Ethereum .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 How much sleep would you lose if ETH retraced to $ 700 ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`That fucking moment you check in on the charts and see a massive graph downwards , only to see its not ETH but XRP .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`You see what we did with ETH ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`In 2017 after reading a story where a guy named Bruce dropped everything , caught a train to Wellington , took out a gold bar from his safe deposit box and bought all the ETH he could .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`LTC trying to out   do ETH on its record breaking day .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 And over time bitcoin is going to be a very scarce resource so expect companies jumping onto alts like ETH and LTC .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I have a suspicion Elon is having a look at ETH and liking what he sees .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`How you like waking to BTC 55k and ETH 2k ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I threw my ETH into Binance and staked with BETH so have it locked away until ETH 2.0 comes out .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone clear on what the Amazon Ethereum announcement is all about ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is an altcoin and is the crypto with more devs working on it then the rest of the crypto world combined .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`
 Its good they 're still loading up on ETH , will give the other instos watching on the sidelines of what to jump into .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`ETH keeping up with BTC for once , even a little better .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I only say BTC , ETH so its win / win .`

 ETH will get its day , and will bloody the bully boys nose well and good . 

 And it will be a might blow .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I can see Elon as a mega ETH fan , he 's not done anything about it yet , maybe schooling himself a bit more .`

TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm not a member there but feel like joining just to post ' Is ETH any good ' and then summarily get banned a few minutes later .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Make sure BTC and ETH are two of them and its a crapshoot for the others .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Could be scary at the top on the way down , but that s a while away , when ETH is post 10k .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`But there was a glimmer of hope when one time I shouted out at a social tennis game ' what the fuck is Ethereum ' and two people answered .`

TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Yep about right I reckon we 'll get ETH to 10k before BTC 100k .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 E~~ar~~th day

 It all makes sense now you see how much smarts ETH has .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`That s right ETH holding up remarkably well compared to the weekend when BTC crashed ETH crashed to 1900 .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`And yea , amazed you 're thinking that way because my DCA is about to hit and I 'm honestly thinking to just go all ETH .`

TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 I have some ETH sitting on a ledger doing nada , but after being burned with the cryptopia hack very very reluctant to move it .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Yes that s the spirit get in on the ETH ride still a good few weeks till 1559 is live .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`There 's a gazillion articles out there why ETH is the best crypto , devs think so to , have the majority of them working on it .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Its done a fucking A1 job of why ETH is the best .`

TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`ETH and BTC as your majority holding and you wo n't go wrong .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`This is a great concise recap , especially the bit where ETH is doing what ETH is doing .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Who knows it could even be ETH with 2.0 fully implemented .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Lets keep this party going and push ETH to 3k this weekend .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`My ETH journey started 3 years ago , still on it , not swapping it for anything else , nothing has come close to ETH in that time .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll take off whatever you want to be on the ETH ride .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 I already told my boss not to fuck with me today I 'm watching ETH reach 3k .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`The sooner people realize this the sooner ETH will be 10k .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 Mine happened organically , this rise to 3k and beyond made my ETH % organically go past 50 % .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`By December 2017 it was $ 20k 

 It 's now the 3rd of May and Ethereum hit $ 3100 .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 People thinking 10k ETH ludicrous need to reset their thinking .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Seeing a 3200 ETH has me smacking my head every other minute to check I 'm not dreaming .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 And now I see ETH doing the same thing , beginning of the year $ 750 and now fuck me , history repeats .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Yea a lot more coins in circulation but holy shit with the improvements hitting in readiness for 2.0 who 's to say we wo nt see a 10k ETH EOY or sooner .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I saw ETH fall 90 % in 2018 .`

 I 've seen ETH go to 1400 in 2018 back down to 80 and look at it today .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Would be very interesting to see how many times ETH has been mentioned in this daily .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 How much will the price of Ethereum move by Monday , May 3rd ? : You earned 249 tokens 

 How 'd you guys do in last weeks polls ?`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`( 3,887.50 % )

TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Here to say that ETH is groot .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Just saw ETH quietly sneak past 3500 .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`I know ETH & amp ; BTC will be giving me enough yield to live off and my moons will pay for the seeds of my loins day care .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`

 I 'm bullish for ETH , but do n't see it getting there this year .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`And I 've already stated in another thread if ETH makes 10k I 'm ready with a washed bottom for a right royal rogering .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`It will be a shock for many , but I 'm thinking those that get out with stonking good profits will put it back into crypto , maybe to the next big pump and dump but some to BTC / ETH .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`Now look what the fuck you did snl , my erection for ETH has gone .`
TheGreatCryptopo,favor,Ethereum,`That s what the fucker was in Jan for a whole ETH . 

 And hell yes its solid .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I hope not , I am almost all in on ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah , but USDT was trading 5 % , or even more , of the peg very frequently these days , so I do n't think Binance is a reliable source for historical ETH / USD data .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`You do n't need 32 ETH to stake , there are several pools already where you can pool less that 32ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`After that the inflation rate will be insignificant for both bitcoin and Ethereum I guess .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has been growing faster than it scaled , that 's why the fees went up dramatically .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Why would you move your bitcoin around , other than in and out of your wallet once in a while ? 

 A whole decentralized financial ecosystem is running on Ethereum which so many people are using which made the fees go up dramatically .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`If they do I guess they are a bit late to the party , several Ethereum scaling solutions are already live ( based on optimistic and zk rollups ) , and Ethereum upgrades are on their way .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Those coins you mention either do n't have smart contracts or are n't decentralized much ( Ethereum already has close to 90,000 trustless staking nodes running ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`It 's all about decentralization : Ethereum currently already has over 90,000 trustless staking nodes running .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Personally I prefer to use Ethereum L2 's for that , but I admit that it will take some time before most of DeFi will be utilizing those and before that these L2 solutions will fully get adopted by exchanges and such .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Actually the ETH / BTC ratio was about the same when bitcoin reached it 's ATH in 2017 .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Several exchanges allow you to stake , and give you a token that represents the staked ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`You can then trade this token back to ETH if you wish ( this token may however trade at lower value than ETH ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Personally I am waiting for Rocketpool , since I think they are the most trustworthy and decentralized option if you want to stake in a pool , and also because it 's better for the Ethereum network ( compared to staking on a centralized Exchange ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Personally I will stake at Rocketpool when the are ready , as I think that will be the most decentralized and trustworthy pool to stake ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Because cz continuously lies about what it is ( calling his centralized chain defi and comparing it to Ethereum ) , and lots of people believe it .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;because the binance smart chain is a ~~serious~~ * * centralized version of * * Ethereum .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`It 's not innovative though , it 's just a highly centralized copy of Ethereum .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Also the fact that CZ pretends that his chain is decentralized , while it 's just a centralized , simple copy & amp ; paste , version of Ethereum .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`
  Binance dex is a big lie , it 's just a simple copy & amp ; paste copy of Ethereum .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 But of course ETH is not an alt either , it 's the first and only Decentralized Finance ecosystem .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum of course is n't a dex , to even suggest that is hilarious , lol .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`My wording was n't accurate , it is better to say " Binance DeFi is a big lie , it 's chain is just a simple copy & amp ; paste copy of Ethereum " .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 As others have said , I think it 's actually good for Ethereum that new users can easily try defi like products , even if it 's on centralized chains like Binance chain .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is decentralized , but that does n't mean the code is n't updated .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 The Ethereum devs are very well aware of the potential problems with quantum computing , and quantum resistant encryption can and will be implemented once it 's deemed necessary .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 I also assume most other blockchain networks will follow once Ethereum is upgraded to be quantum resistance .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I know Ethereum devs have their upgrade plans ready , I assume Bitcoin devs are prepared too , and most other networks will follow soon after the big ones have upgraded ( or they will disappear , wich is fine too ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`The Ethereum foundation has offered Reddit support to make moons scalable .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Most coins have trading pairs with Bitcoin and Ether , so they are all coupled .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I think a huge difference is that Ethereum has several ( defi ) dapps that are quite popular .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 I also expect several exchanges to offer direct deposits into Ethereum L2 's at some point , which will take away the hurdle to enter L2 's for new users .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I think a huge difference is that Ethereum has several ( defi ) dapps that are quite popular .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 I also expect several exchanges to offer direct deposits into Ethereum L2 's at some point , which will take away the hurdle to enter L2 's for new users .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 That 's approximately what I recall from Ethereum dev talks about the subject .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 It would be really bad if Binance ( just to name a random one , lol ) would be the only centralized service to offer Ethereum staking to it 's users for example .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 The network fee for moving ETH currently is about $ 3 currently , but exchanges charge about $ 35 according to OP .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Binance us even charges $ 20 for a regular ETH withdrawal ! 

 But it looks lik OP pulled his numbers from a place where the sun does n't shine ;) 

 Anyway , several reliable exchanges that do n't charge that much exist , and the difference is not insignificant .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah I read today in another thread that the average fee to move ETH out of an exchange was 0.02 ETH ! 

 I found this very weird because * * I very recently payed less than $ 3 , or 0.0017 ETH , for my ETH withdrawal at Kraken .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`* 

 ( note that $ 3 approximately also is the current network fee for regular ETH transactions ) 

 And indeed " withdrawing " to BSC does n't make much sense because that means your ETH will still be at Binance , and you will only have an IOU token in your wallet .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`( like Binance US for example ) 

 I currently do n't use CB Pro , but I think the withdrawal fee for ETH is about $ 3 currently .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;Edit 2 : The withdrawal fee which I stated for ETH ( 0.02 ) was for the exchange I primarily use which is WazirX. I ’m sorry for not mentioning the said exchange and for those asking where I got that figure here is your answer .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Just so you know : on Kraken you currently only pay 0.0017 ETH ( about $ 3 ) which is approximately the current cost of an ETH transfer on the network and less than a tenth of what you pay .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 It 's also clear from support questions that many users do n't understand what happened to their Ether after they have " withdrawn " .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Binance should call it a bridge or conversion , or whatever it is they do with the ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;You clearly not using ethereum that often if you do n't know sending eth will cost you around 20bucks in gas now .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I love Ethereum as much as you do , but while the high fees are definitely a sign of adoption , they currently slow down the adoption of Ethereum .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Bradcoops stated that it cost him $ 40 * * just to withdraw to his wallet * * , which is nowhere near the current network fee to move ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`0.02 ETH for withdrawing ETH to wallet is n't normal .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

  I think I would create my nft 's on xdai network , which is very cheap , and only move them to Ethereum when needed ( or wait for lower fees ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Maybe because most of the active Ethereum users are more active on these two other subs 

 r / ethfinance 
 and 
 r / ethtrader 

 Or maybe it 's because Optimism is currently better known than zksync , but I think ( and hope ) this will change soon .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`They are expected to release soon ( next month maybe ) , and you can then stake ETH by simply holding rETH tokens .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Note that fees can be payed with any token on zkSync ( not sure if that 's the case now , or after the coming upgrade , I currently only have some ETH on zkSync ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Are you sure you mined ETH ?`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Even in this sub only a few seem to understand what Ethereum is actually .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 It 's incredible how little people know about the current developments on Ethereum in this sub .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`ETH killer maxis still got nothing to do with their coins , so making themselves " useful " by downvoting the painful truth , lol .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 There are several other Ethereum staking services , but do n't know how trustworthy and ( de)centralized those are .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 I can recommend r / ethstaker if your seriously interested in staking ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`And many big months for Ethereum about to follow .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I heard they are partners now ! 

 Bitcoin & lt;3 Ethereum 

  ;)`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't know the current transaction costs on bitcoin , but I guess it higher for wrapped bitcoin currently ( and definitely higher than for ETH , as it 's an ERC20 ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Of course on the receiving end an exchange , or in your case a casino , may require you to send your USDT to another address than that the want you to send ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 ? 

 & gt;The new fee structure will allow DeFi projects to pay less for their transactions on the Ethereum network .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure what OP means , but most of the currently available coins are either Ethereum ERC20 tokens , or tokens on an Ethereum copy pasta chain .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I think they only mean the tokens that run on Ethereum mainnet .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`The day I come by a store that allows me to pay for a croissant using an Ethereum rollup , I will definitely buy one .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 As by far most of the development and innovation happens on Ethereum , even way more than all other chains combined , of course there will be delays on a regular basis .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Several Zk rollups are already live on Ethereum main net now , which means we have layer 2 scaling with layer 1 security .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`The prospects for ETH are very good because Ethereum is miles ahead of any competitor , and because by far the most devs are working on Ethereum and Ethereum related projects .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 For a nice overview on what 's currently going on at Ethereum you can look here : 
 https://ethstaker.cc/ethosphere-timeline-update-28-march-2021/ 

 For discussion about ETH finance I can recommend r / ethfinance .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Now that the Beacon chain is up and running on Ethereum it is expected that it 's soon possible to secure the Ethereum chain by a pure PoS consensus mechanism , which is expected to be even [ more secure and decentralized](https://vitalik.ca / general/2020/11/06 / pos2020.html ) than Ethereum is today .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Due to the current high network load on Ethereum , combined with the basic bidding system , it 's currently not really possible to determine what a reasonable bid would be to have your transaction accepted .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`On a positive note : 

 [ Immutable X is coming to OpenSea!](https://twitter.com / opensea / status/1377352145666641923 ) 

 & gt ; We 're excited to announce OpenSea will soon support the trading of NFTs on their gas - free layer-2 protocol , built directly on Ethereum .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`If you swap on a regular basis , I think the cheapest / best options are to transfer your ETH to a centralized exchange and trade there , or use a rollup exchange ( Loopring , dYdX and Deversifi come to mind but I think there are more and the list is growing fast ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`There are more Ethereum communities on reddit , maybe one of the others suits you better ?`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`If Binance did not warn you * * very * * clearly at the time that " withdrawing " to BC or BSC is actually converting ETH to a pegged token , and withdrawing that token to the Binance network , I think they are 100 % responsible , especially since they made withdrawing to their own network the default in stead of the Ethereum network .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I think this is better asked at r / ethfinance 

 But this thread might also your questions : [ The Ethereum Value Proposition : A Beginner 's Guide](https://np.reddit.com / r / CryptoCurrency / comments / mdrc4t / the_ethereum_value_proposition_a_beginners_guide/ )`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`It possible to stake on a Raspberry Pi , not that I would recommend that because the Pi may not be able to keep up under circumstances , and will definitely not be enough when Ethereum switches to full PoS. Visit r / ethstaker if you want to know more .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`It 's easy to go through dips , and even bear markets are bearable with , since you can be sure Ethereum is here to stay and grow long term .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Is this version of Ethereum on Arm already updated for Berlin ?`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Most if them do n't think Ethereum is a scam , but they like to call it a scam to protect their bags .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm sure they will let you back in if you promise to say that Ethereum is a scam and ETH is a shitcoin .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;If you do n't understand why the transactions rollback is extremely bad 

 By your own logic Bitcoin is a shitcoin and a scam : 

 https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-history-part-10-the-184-billion-btc-bug/ 

 https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures 



 Also no transactions have been ever reverted on the Ethereum chain .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 How much do you think an ETH presale wallet costed ? ?`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Joining the Ethereum presale was * * much * * easier than setting up a mining rig for people that were new to the space .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Bitcoin maxis often claim that the Ethereum chain has been rolled back , and apperantly people believe it , but it 's actually the bitcoin chain that has been rolled back ( can post proof of that you like ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Are you suggesting Bitcoin and Ethereum are mostly similar ?`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I assume you 're talking about the transaction volume in ETH .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Several exchanges let you trade in and out of staked ETH tokens .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Make sure to withdraw to the Ethereum main net though , the other options to " withdraw " on Binance are actually bridges and will result in getting a peg ETH token on bsc in stead of real ETH ( so that would decrease the security in stead of increase ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I think Rocketpool will allow to withdraw before ETH 2 will , if you run a minipool .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;I do n't think that ETH mainnet will ever be sub $ 1 again 

 I agree .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Did you really put your eth in the staking contract without considering any price fluctuations ?`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`You would actually have to overpay substantially to spend more than $ 10 for sending ETH at this point .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`ETC is crap , do n't confuse it with ETH !`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`The Ethereum * * chain * * was never rolled back , one of the first buggy smart contracts was .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`It 's often people try to trade on low liquidity , and experience slippage , but they blame it on Ethereum fees .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Not sure if this rounded from 9.99999 % or something , but I have followed Ethereum pretty close since genesis and I do n't recall any downtime of the network .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`While absurdly high fees would be disappointing , it seems very unlikely that would crash ETH though as the fees will only be high as long as usage is high`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I think Trezor suite did n't support Ethereum in the early days , and Myetherwallet and MyCrypto were recommended wallets to allow you interact with Ethereum at the time when using a Trezor .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I am afraid you exchanged your ETH for a bsc - ETH token .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Has n't Binance made clear that the token you bought there was n't ETH ?`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`It depends , Uniswap supports Ethereum tokens .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 I assume you mean they do n't develop the protocol itself , but research and development on Ethereum is done by the [ EEA](https://entethalliance.org / eea - members/ ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`That 's one of the reasons Ethereum is moving to PoS. This will reduce energy consumption by 99 % .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`The downside to that is that , if Binance goes down one day your ETH will be gone .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Actually Ethereum will have decentralized staking pools as well , these will increase decentralization .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;stake as little as 0.1 ETH 

 0.01 ETH . 

 And I think you can also buy smaller fractions , once rETH is listed on exchanges .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`( not where I live ) 

 But if you decide to swap your ETH for a pegged token , make sure you only send it to bsc compatible wallets , and exchanges , or your funds will be lost .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 [ https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058809292-How-to-view-ETC-Ethereum-Classsic-token-](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058809292-How-to-view-ETC-Ethereum-Classsic-token- ) 

 Personally I would then send back the ETC to Coinbase   ( make 100 % sure to send ETC to the Coinbase ETC wallet on the ETC network , not ETH ) , and then remove the ETC network from metamask again to avoid any future confusion .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Not really an answer to your question , but this made me think about the following : 

 JP Morgan buys billions worth of ETH , and starts staking .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Their staking nodes get slashed , their ETH gets burned , and the incident goes into history as the biggest destruction of enterprise capital ever .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 Holding BETH is riskier than holding ETH , especially for prolonged periods of time .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`But I assume " alt " stands for " alternative " , and I think Ether is n't an alternative to any other coin .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`I have never used it , but it should be possible using the bridge : 

 https://www.binance.org/en/bridge 

 I think you can also deposit your peg ETH to Binance , and then withdraw to the Ethereum main net ( which they call ERC20 I think ) .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you want to know more about Ethereum staking in general , and maybe run your own staking node , I suggest to visit r / ethstaker`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`

 On ( some of ) the Ethereum rollups you will be able to choose the token to pay the fees with , on L1 it will always be Ether .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`Interesting . 

 So when you think you buy ETH on Binance , you probably get the peg token instead .`
Mathje,favor,Ethereum,`And to withdraw this " ETH " Binance charges their users to bridge the peg tokens to Ethereum .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I plan to DCA BTC & amp ; ETH from next month though ( never too late right ? )`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I feel that ZIL has potential to grow but do n't think any coin will replace ETH`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Guess many are waiting for the ETH bridge .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I should stick with DCAing ETH & amp ; BTC : ‘ ） 

 Still gon na hodl my fomo buys tho ( & amp ; some other altcoins which I think have potential )`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Oh wait , it seems like ETH staking is unavailable now .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`

 Planning to DCA into bth/ eth from now on lol .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I started with lots of alts ( 90 % of my portfolio is alts currently ) & amp ; I 'm trying to dca BTC/ ETH each month to increase the ratio of BTC/ ETH in my portfolio .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`DCA a small amount to alts which you think have a promising future if you want to , and leave the rest to eth ;D hahaha`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`But I think it would be good for them to start with BTC/ ETH then move on to other altcoins .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Haha I wish I have a lump sum to put in eth and then continue to dca each month 😂 but sadly I do n’t lol so I shall dca and add more each month .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Welcome\~ :D 

 hope you meant ETH :p`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`But I got eth after selling it so it ’s okay I guess 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Pay is in finally but everything is high now ; o 

 Guess I will just get some ETH first ...`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I think it is good to hold on to your eth`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Look at ETH go ! 🤩`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Does n’t matter , I ’m working towards more ETH as well .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Zil , ETH , XLM going up today is making my portfolio very green 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`So happy that ETH , DOT , UNI , LINK moved ;) 

 & amp ; Zil too .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I feel like it 's good to diversify tho , maybe just DCA/ add more to ETH when you are getting more ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I started with all alts but slowly added btc and eth 😂 

 I guess some people prefer high risk coins that may pay off ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is making himself comfy above 2k .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`2k looks really good on ETH & lt;3 

 What Easter candies are you guys having today ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Think it ’s a win as long as ETH remains above 2k .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH , Zil , Vet , XLM making me very happy today .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I added more eth when it dipped under 2.1k ytd 😂 when I have no fiat , then I just hodl 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I just feel like adding more to eth and zil everyday 😂 but I shall hodl on my dca dates since I already used up my spare fiat yesterday`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Finally able to check charts during lunch hour & amp ; holy ETH ! 

 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`What did you get after selling ETH ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`😂 Hope you got gains from BNB & amp ; throw it back to ETH ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Vechain holding well & amp ; ETH staying above 2.3k !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Go on ETH , you know you wanna break 2.5k .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m happy that ETH is above 2.5k and zil is at 0.21 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`So I got a little more ETH today ;) could n’t pass it up`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Fomo & amp ; probably lots of new investors coming in and grabbing the cheaper ver of what they think is ' BTC , ETH ' etc ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't have that much ETH for staking , waiting for staking pools`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t have as much lol still working on accumulating more ETH but I still staked whatever I have so I wo n’t be tempted to touch it`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Hope you get enough gains from alts & amp ; throw them in btc/ ETH ;)`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Still hope ETH does well and you get good gains tho`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Hope you have some BTC/ ETH .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I missed 2k ETH cos there was delays in getting usdt through p2p .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I scooped some ETH at 2.1k 😂 

 Also scooped some btc since I realised alts make up 80 % of my portfolio , so I ’m trying to increase the btc & amp ; eth ratio in my portfolio`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Hahaha I wish I have more eth tho !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`got some btc/ eth , set some buy orders for vet`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`0.1 ETH is a lot lol I 'm buying way lesser but I just try to accumulate as much as I can lol`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`😂 I get around that much eth each dip too 😂 wish I have more fiat`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I have eth and other cryptos so I think I will be fine 😂 

 Happy cake day btw !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`If you ’re not planning on selling and have already changed it for Beth then leave it till ETH 2.0 ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Yes happy to see eth making a recovery and holding up well`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m not gon na sell any of my ETH , if bear market comes and the price dips , then I ’m just gon na dca each month to lower the average of my eth 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Yep they have n’t reached my target goal yet so I ’m gon na hodl for a while more then off I convert them to eth and btc 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I feel like buying more eth and btc before 4/20 cos I feel some of the profits might be moved to these coins`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Hmm I believe btc and eth will rise back so I ’m not worried about them tbh`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Btc and eth are the ones I believe will go through bear markets well but my alts I ’m not that sure`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I see them accepting BTC/ ETH first than doge tho`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`& amp ; ETH green again .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`We see green again & amp ; ETH about to cross 2.3k again ahh .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m staking mine on Binance ( I do n’t have a lot of eth so have to do it on exchange ) & amp ; you can trade Beth back to eth whenever you want`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I ’ll get some btc/ eth , or were you planning to get them later ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`btc and eth are long term holds for me so I 'm just stacking and getting whatever I can`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Good to start with BTC/ ETH but you might also want to research on other altcoins and see which projects you believe have potential in the long run`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm trying to rectify it by DCAing ETH and BTC each month .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Do n't even know where ETH will bring us now`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH , Matic , Link making me happy today .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`& amp ; ETH is back above 2.2k ...`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I started with alts so my portfolio is still mainly alts ( originally 90 % alts but now I ’m trying to get more btc / eth so it ’s 65 - 70 % alts now ) Guess I still have some way to go .. 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`nope , ETH still has lots of potential , I would use fiat to get more sats now and keep my ETH`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`

 Crypto was abit daunting to me at first ( BTC was so ex & amp ; I did n't know you can buy a fraction of the coins ) so I started with alts , Started to get serious investing in crypto this year and am trying to balance the alts to btc / eth ratio in my portfolio now`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Will need to rebalance portfolios and make it more btc/ eth heavy .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Haha I grabbed some alts and btc and eth this week 😂 could n’t resist btc too`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`& amp ; holy ETH !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I believe there ’s good stuff in store for the future of ETH . 

 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`

 I do n’t hold atom currently so I will buy more eth I guess`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m planning on getting more ETH too !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Excited about Zil & amp ; ETH .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH got no chill & amp ; I 'm loving it 

 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Bullish , I wonder if more institutions will announce they got some ETH too`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`  


 BTC & amp ; ETH are the safer choices but you can also get altcoins ( Vet , Zil , Algo etc ) depending on whether you believe the project ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Initially thought ETH might reach 5k by eoy .. it might actually hit 5k in the next few months 😳`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Hope you guys are having a great day so far\~ 

 I see ETH still strong above 2.7k 🤩 

 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`It 's a great start & amp ; ETH is a solid coin !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`🤦 ‍ ♀ ️ ah well glad at least one of them put the money into ETH !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH , BTC , Vet , Algo and maybe Zil ? 

 Stake whatever you can stake to earn some passive income while holding too`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`My payday is next week & amp ; i m planning to get some eth ... 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`eth lifting my portfolio on his strong shoulders now :')`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Just eth casually reaching new ATH daily 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Just a month earlier ( ? ) people were making fun of ETH being at 1.7k , guess ETH got angry & gt ; ;)`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`If you 're holding long term , might be good to get btc/ eth or coins you can stake tho .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I would hold btc tho , try to get ETH using fiat instead ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Cos I do n’t have 32 eth now too ... is there a calculator to calculate ?`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Think some were saying they 're gon na wait for rocketpool to stake their ETH .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`You will feel that way no matter how much ETH you own ... 

 I need to buy more :')`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is on 🔥 

 Thought we will only hit 3k in the next 2 weeks or so but it seems like it just keep going and going 🤩`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Nice to see ETH spushing for 3k 😍 & amp ; Nano 🤩 

 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Think ETH will still be one of the top , there might be competitors but I believe ETH will still do well .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`

 Maybe you can get some DeFi coins if you want to ( I 'm holding some ) but might convert a portion of them to BTC/ ETH in future`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm ready for ETH to melt my face`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ahh .. you planning to hold your eth for long ? maybe staking it would be good`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Have to mine fiat but I see ETH briefly hitting 3k ? ? !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`It 's a great day for ETH , hoping we can keep going`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I told her NO & amp ; that she should use the money to get ETH or vet instead 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I hold both ( more eth than Ada ) but I find it dumb to constantly shit on other coins tho .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I would stake that ETH and use fiat to buy ADA`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't know if I should give in to FOMO and get more ETH now or what ..`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m thinking of scooping some btc or lto myself 😂 I ’ve got buy orders set for eth as well`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m holding Ada , dot , zil 😂 and eth but I believe the time will come for all these alts .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s so fun tho ... ah well , I ’ll just use the money to get more eth or something 😂 

 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`& amp ; maybe LTO too 

 I wanna get more ETH but I 'm waiting for it to cool a little ( will it ? lol )`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`still good I guess , bought some ETH . thinking of adding some alts or btc`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Probably have to wait for eth 2.0 for mainnet tho since they mentioned before that it ’s on the testnet due to the transaction costs`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH , Vet , Zil , Ada , XLM and Algo making me happy today .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Btc and eth are considered the safer crypto but like every other investments , there ’s still risks .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I think it 's still alright to get ETH , not matter how much money you have .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH & amp ; BTC for sure , would topup on coins that I already own`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t make me more bullish for eth ! 😂`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has been staying strong this few weeks , should be fine`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`[ gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak ) ETH continuing to make us happy everyday ;D`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`& amp ; 🤩 ETH is higher than when I went to bed 😂 

 !`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH should be good if you 're planning on holding for long .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`I guess due to sharding but I do n’t think they ’re trying to be a eth killer , cos I think their focus seems to be in Asia instead .`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`

 ' hey buy our coin , ETH founder has it too ! '`
maolyx,favor,Ethereum,`ETH on 🔥 ! 

 & amp ; I see zil slowly creeping up 😂`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Pretty sure they were waiting for BTC to stop moving before converting funds to ETH .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`* * ETH * *   until launch threshold 

 It 's happening \^.\^`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It allows you to give up your precious ETH for a worthless IOU proxy token .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Am I wrong for thinking the speculation that ETH could be deflationary within 5 years is crazy ?`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 When you try telling people to use your dApp and they go to try it , they 'll leave once they realize they need another token to pay for gas fees since they were expecting to just need eth for gas .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;the possibilities 

 And this is what they sell you on to give them your precious ETH and BTC .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;you already stated it with not settling 

 This was in reference to them saying Ethereum must not settle .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I was simply saying that Ethereum is n't settling .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`There 's a big difference between launching something for the first time and upgrading a live system . 

 & gt;Sure , ETH is number two , but Blockchain 3.0 is by nature way faster as it has the advantage of learning from mistakes .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`" I will make the first part of my comment in support of ETH so I gain a favorable view point from the reader , and in the 2nd part of my comment I will shill my bags . "`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; they are both leading competitors 

 No , ETH is the clear leader and cardano is just watching their hands in the back of the room screaming " hey patty attention to me , somebody please ! " 

 & gt ; Do people really think that the comment section of a subreddit moves markets ? 

 Yes , overtime it does make a difference because it sows doubt for people that do n't know any better and that spreads .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`There will come a time when a protocol is finalized that does certain things better than ETH , the same way new software frameworks for web / app development are invented that specialize in performance , readability , etc . 

 I agree with the programming trade offs but i think the comparison is incorrect .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`So let 's say the inflation is 5 % , but 6 % of ETH is burnt from fees , then you 've effectively accomplished the best of both worlds .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Staking on Ethereum was built specifically to make it as accessible to everyone as possible .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`You do n't use a full ETH every time you want to do something , you use just as much as is needed .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Even if ETH was $ 1 M , the lower boundary for how much it would cost for a transaction is $ 0.0000000000001 ( 1 Wei ) .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`What I explained in the post above is how the price per ETH can still be high , but transactions can still be affordable .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`This is n't the norm but the demand on ETH is so high that it 's exceeding the capacity of the chain .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It also includes other things like burning gas fees which will contribute to making ETH deflationary .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`For earning interest on Celsius and Nexo , are n't they putting the ETH into liquidity pools where 50 % of your ETH would be split into a stablecoin ?`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 To get this value yourself to confirm against this tweet , you 'd need to do either some on - chain analysis ( if you consider available ETH to sell is anything on an exchange ) or you 'd need to tap into the API of all exchanges and pull the total number of ETH for sale on all the orderbooks .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It means the amount of ETH still on exchanges ( and therefor implies it 's willing to be sold ) is less than 10.5M. This creates a huge strain on supply and generally translates to price jumps .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`That could really screw you over depending on how much you 're staking and what the price of eth goes up to .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Pretty sure I saw that ETH will include quantum proof accounts .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`All other chains are just copying things that Ethereum has done or is in the process of doing .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If Cardano was the first to be doing what they 're doing like Ethereum was in 2016 , then yes it 's more understandable that it 'd take as long as it 's taken them .`

 If you 're asking me if I think the issues with Ethereum gas fees will change then yes I 100 % do .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Not to mention Ethereum is upgrading a moving system faster than Cardano is launching from scratch , which is really embarrassing .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Now let 's assume you 're delusional enough to still believe Cardano can compete with Ethereum .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I highly suggest you read this post ( along with the part 1 linked ) since it is a nice roundup that shows the depth of Ethereum : 

 https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/l5gkqu/a_break_down_of_the_bull_case_for_ethereum_part_2/`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It 's the level of decentralization , it 's the number of developers , it 's the network effect , it 's the partnerships , the software and tooling , the redundancies , the economics , etc . 

 I suggest you give this post a read as it does a good job giving some insight into the depth of Ethereum .`

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 & gt;what are the odds it gets left behind with other smart contract cryptos ? 

 So to answer your question , the odds are small that Ethereum will get left behind .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`And it 's stuff like this going on in the ecosystem that make me laugh when people think Ethereum will get taken over by whatever new " Ethereum killer " is hot now .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`One might say a portfolio without ETH is financial malfeasance .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;Stop pretending you can " kill " Ethereum and starting thinking how you can contribute to the world Ethereum is creating .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`When you claim you 're an ETH killer , you get to sell people on the idea that the project will be worth more than Ethereum which has a market cap of $ 200B , the most decentralized chain , most decentralized developer network , most tooling , most enterprise partnerships , etc .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Ask Ethereum Classic miners how that mindset is working for them`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`
 * Ethereum has a lot more developers , the development is very decentralized , there 's a ton of software and tooling to support developers , there 's a much bigger ecosystem of projects and users , there 's so many developers that we have the benefit of redundancy where multiple developers / teams can work on competing implementations .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`They do n't have any of the partnerships , tooling , developer network , etc that Ethereum has to offer .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Perhaps instead of talking about revolt we should instead say that unless we are respected we will ell off all out eth at once and crash the price .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Honestly my best strategy is to threathen that if 1559 passes without 969 miner will all sell off their eth and crash the price  
 & gt ;  
 & gt;(4/7 )`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`we are n't even near it yet , 1559 is 3 months away  
 & gt ;  
 & gt;(5/7 ) Flexpool is the 22nd largest pool and our largest miner has 401 eth  
 & gt ;  
 & gt;(6/7 )`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,` 
 & gt ;  
 & gt;(7/7 ) If miners have to accept shutting down after 1559 because mining becomes unprofitable than we will burn ETH to the ground with us . 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 * This is why it 's great that ETH is so decentralized 
 * Extortion never really works well when you are n't relied upon 
 * Getting your way with devs by threatening to try and ruin all the hard work devs have put into the project is not a great way to win them or anybody else over 
 * If you need to resort to ultimatums then that means you do n't really have any good arguments 
 * LOL so you 're threatening us with cheap eth ? bring on the discounts !`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't think they realize how much volume eth has if they think that will " crash the price " 
 * Sell your bags already and leave , we do n't care .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I would n't be surprised if that 's how they do it in the future once we 're at ETH1.5 ( ETH goes 100 % staking ) .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Once ETH1.5 is released ( ETH goes 100 % staking ) then you 'll be able to withdraw whenever you want .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is a smart contract platform and the more those get used , the more ETH gets used , the more people need to own ETH , the more buying that happens .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin does n't have this option and once those large investors learn more about the ecosystem and that everything that 's anything is being built on Ethereum and that you can also produce low risk interest through staking then they 'll be all over that .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is in no way in a bubble currently , although it 's at the cusp of a transitionary period on it 's way to approach bubble territory .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Every now and then I check out Cardano posts and all their arguments are either based on a false premise , stated in a way that makes you think it 's only a feature of Cardano and not ETH , or just state differences in a way that makes you think it 's an advantage .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`What I 'm saying is that just because he 's doing other stuff does n't mean he 's not working on ETH .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; We are now following a roll up centric approach to scaling 

 That 's ETH 1.5 , not 2.0 .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Your comment history shows quite clearly that you 're a bitcoin maxi and anti - eth .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It seems like they were originally built to be blockchain agnostic but then realized ETH is king ( rendering their original vision less useful ) and have since pivoted to allowing you to launch projects on it so they can try and catch some defi hype ?`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`What do they offer that Ethereum ca n't do ?`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH is used more , then more will be burnt and make it deflationary .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Their success fully relies on Ethereum failing so they 're constantly slandering and making things up .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Good thing is that they 'll wake up one day in a few months and realize that Ethereum is no longer expensive to use even though the Cardano community is still saying they are .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It 's at that point they 'll wake up and realize they were grifted and they wo n't be fooled when the next " Ethereum killer " built on false premise comes along .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It 's trying to infer that L1s like Ethereum will be powered by Polkadot .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`One might argue that ETH invented Web 3`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 IDK how ETH differs from Bitcoin ( still learning the nitty gritty details ) , but with UTXO chains in order to determine the balance of an address you need to look at the entire chain to get to the result .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH is similar to this , then getbalance calls are something everyone will require and would need these more centralized ( less decentralized ? ) witnesses .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I believe the network will rally behind Optimism due to large names that have already committed to it , the ease of deploying to Optimistic Rollups ( little to no code changes required ) , it has general compute , and it uses ETH for gas rather than some random token .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If you have to ask that then here 's a general list of reading material ( no particular order ): 

 * [ Bull case for Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com / r / ethtrader / comments / lnif8b / the_bull_case_for_ethereum_extended_wip/ )

Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`The argument is that some entity can just buy up a bunch of ETH to control the network .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Not to mention you 'd get to keep attacking the network once you own the mining equipment rather than losing that investment as would happen with Ethereum PoS. 

 Third , to address their nonsense about spiraling costs of an attack since the security is directly tied to the price of ETH , this is n't very different than how it works with Bitcoin .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Not to mention all enterprise is building on eth .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; they advertize as being a " ETH v3 " network 

 That just screams scammy and would be enough for me .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Aka it sounds like a money grab meme coin like all those " blockchain 3.0 " ones in 2017 . 

 & gt;Is it viable long term ? 

 Again going off their " eth 3.0 " comment it seems like they just want to ride the meme and will disappear after this bull run like happened this past cycle ( aion anyone ? ) 

 & gt;What problems do you think they will have ? 

 Decentralization , getting developers and users , keeping up with innovations in the space , and the lawsuit ( and if successful potentially a class action fraud lawsuit from investors )`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Got ta love how when it 's good news they either do n't mention " Ethereum " or they word it in a negative sounding way like " destroy coins " which will scare noobs that do n't know any better .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`The benefit is that you 'll not only earn the normal ETH staking rewards , but you 'll also earn ETH commission from your pool ( the 16 ETH from others ) , as well as RPL staking rewards .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Due to lockup from the 10 % RPL collateral required to operate a Rocket Pool node and the TVL from the locked ETH and RPL , I imagine the RPL rewards could be fairly handsome .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`By providing Rocket Pool smart nodes , you are giving people with as little as 0.01 Ether the option to participate in decentralized staking .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 It also gives responsible Ethereans without 32 Ether the chance to participate in staking in a way that 's most healthy for the network .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;nobody in eth community knows what decentralization is .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Regardless , if that 's what you believe , ETH will soon have lower inflation than bitcoin , and possibly even deflation .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If scarcity is what you 're after then ETH is where it 's at .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Every so often I still see people claiming that Bitcoin can do everything that Ethereum can do .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If you 're assuming that after having this online for a year that nobody will attempt to crack it because it 's not worth it even with an assumed known value of 1 ETH , then that means you must also assume that this method of storing is also secure enough for a single person finding it and not knowing if there 's even a balance or not ( or even what it is at all to begin with ) .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Anybody that truly knows ETH inside and out knows that we 're heading to 6 digits next cycle .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`One thing I 'd like to see covered for the next recap if you have the capacity for it is which of these are planning on launching their own tokens vs using ETH as the native fees .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;ultimately irrespective of whether these projects have their own token for additional functionality , all rollups will pay L1 ETH to include the state transitions on mainnet 

 Yeah I understand that , but it 's moreso of me not even wanting exposure to other tokens personally or needing to worry about having them .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Since its a fork of ETH it makes it easy to switch temporarily while L2 is getting sorted out and then easily switch back .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I believe a privacy solution on Ethereum will take the cake`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If anybody here is keen to run some calculations , how much power would the network use under these conditions : 

 * 30 % of ETH staked ( roughly 35 M ETH , 1,093,750 validators ) 
 * Assume everyone is using a Raspberry Pi 4 B 
 * Assume each rpi is only running a single validator 
 * The below average power requirements of the rpi should roughly balance out with the below average validators per machine`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah even EF can dedicate 32 ETH out of their stash to running a node and buying carbon credits to make it a net positive .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Learn to see ETH for the future value and you 'll understand how much of a steal $ 2.5k is and how foolish it 'd be not to do everything in your power to keep acquiring as much as possible .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If you 're aware of everything Ethereum is capable of , it 's predatory nature , and it 's value accrual then you 'd understand it 's a reasonable expectation .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; we need more to make Ethereum to really take off 

 You do realize that there 's a lot happening on this front ?`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`So let 's say for example it was reduced to only needing 1 ETH to staked , as long at 32 people ( or 32 ETH worth ) is pulled from exchanges to stake themselves , exchanges would be at a net negative .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`So let 's say right now an exchange has 2,000 ETH that they want to stake .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`The exchange pool will be able to operate 62 nodes with a remainder of 16 ETH that they ca n't do anything with   
  as it 's less than amount required to run a node ( 2000/32 = 62.5 ) .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Now let 's say the amount was lowered so only 1 ETH is required to run a node .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Now let 's assume the rest of the network has no left over ETH to run additional nodes ( they only had a multiple of 32 ETH ) .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`And that 's assuming nobody withdraws their ETH to stake themselves .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 One users start to withdraw ETH to stake themselves , it only takes 17 ETH to be withdrawn for them to be at a net negative compared to where they were prior to the lowered amount for node collateral .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`He is an ETH researcher and some chain just copied the name of his research ( Casper ) and used the name for their chain , which utilizes his research done for ETH .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;Unrelated question -&gt ; The communty can stake aswel , does the ammount of staked eth in a pool equal its " strength " ?`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`It 's expected that the amount staking will reach an equilibrium at around 3 % APY , which is around 35 M ETH .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`If you put your ETH in a pool and the node operator acts maliciously and gets slashed , his RPL and ETH is auctioned off to cover the pool and then the node operator gets back whatever the remainder is .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;and then have negative net issuance 

 That would be a huge red flag to boomer finance , especially since they think cryptocurrency should be taken as literal as the term and that it 's supposed to be an every day payment method ( personally I do n't think ETH is meant to serve that purpose ) .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I believe they raised their binance withdrawal fees for eth for a period of time`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`I mean , there is one really convincing difference between Ethereum and Cardano , which is that Cardano does n't have smart contracts yet .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Hey , there 's another thing that Cardano has that Ethereum does n't , red flags !`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum goes way deeper than just transactions per second and other chains love to ignore all the soft technicals because they know they ca n't even begin to compete on that front .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`By my projections you should be able to live a modest life from staking rewards from 5 - 20 ETH in another few years .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Meanwhile the Ethereum community is mostly left leaning and want to see things progress .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`  In fact , even YOU could create your own fork of Ethereum — but it ’s highly unlikely anyone will develop and contribute to that community .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;with PoS you ’d need to own 51 % of the ETH in Ethereum – that ’s a lot ! 

 51 % of validators , but point still stands`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;Because ETH is currently near its all - time high , you might want to start with some other coins 

 Uhhhh no , if you understand why it 's # 2 you ca n't in good faith recommend others , let alone XLM and ADA .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Sell your ETC and put all your funds into buying this ETH dip`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; I have much more in ETH than ETC , still I do n’t get the flaming from many ETH holders towards ETC 

 Because it 's just a way to extract money from noobs and likely pushed by miners .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`
 & gt ; 
 & gt ; It should be said that the above is ( mostly ) pertaining for Ethereum Core work , aka the protocol itself .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`The unique relationship of the RPL collateral needed as a function of ETH value means that * * RPL will rise along with the value of ETH *`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Given the limited supply however , it 's expected that the RPL / ETH ratio is severely undervalued and will grow * significantly * .. 

 Operating a Rocket Pool node is highly incentivized as * * it allows for muc****h great****er income * * .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`You receive your normal ETH staking rewards ( on your 16 ETH ) , commission on the ETH staking rewards from the pool ( the other 16 ETH ) , and then you also receive RPL staking rewards on your collateral .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 Uhhhh , ahead of ETH in development by what metric ? lmao`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 As of right now Ethereum is still the only contract chain to achieve decentralization , scalability , and security all at once .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;Are you telling me that more specific use cases like VET and THETA are just going to be disregarded because they have their own networks ? 

 No , what I 'm saying is Ethereum will eat their use - cases . 

 & gt ; That 's asinine in my opinion when people are already developing interoperable methods today .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;it is completely community handled at this point making it more decentralized than Ethereum .`
Hanzburger,favor,Ethereum,`Since they now do n't secure their own chain that makes them more decentralized than Ethereum ?`

 Liquidity preference is where I see a change , as with DeFi growing the way it is , ETH will become the preference .`

 However my main conclusion is that once ETH 2.0 is implemented , there ’s literally no more excuses for anyone and fundamentals will play out .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;It ’s a bit hard to tell if the 32 ETH minimum will cause it to mostly be done by really big players or just a lot of medium players

 Here ’s a visualisation on how the use of Bitcoin has evolved to fit certain narratives - https://miro.medium .com/1*pdvBufRAdPHXtK28AFi7wA.png 

 If you want a crypto with an actual purpose then look at Ethereum .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Your concern is that people hoard their ETH , but if an insufficient amount of people use the network then they are encouraged to use it .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 And finally , I think the great thing about Ethereum is that it is actually * used * .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Now we have ETH futures and DeFi instruments , ETH demand will increase .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 BTC will always have a time preference as it was created first , however as time goes on this becomes proportionally less and more centrally will be negligible in comparison to ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`The Ethereum fee market operates a first price auction model , meaning that in times of congestion users will aim to outbid each other in order to get their transaction processed .`

 L1 scaling - ETH 2.0 will bring us sharding and ~100,000 TPS

 Ethereum operates what is known as Minimum Necessary Issuance - the minimum issuance to secure the network .`

ec265,favor,Ethereum,`* The Ethereum ecosystem has a resolute goal of being a stable and dependable system in the long run , but if you are here in Ethereum today , you should be here not because you believe the current rules ( economic or technical ) deserve to be protected and stabilized at all costs , but because you believe in where the ecosystem is going .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Until then , participation in Ethereum is unavoidably in part a prediction that the roadmap is a good one and that once this upgrading process ends we actually will get to a place where the network is efficient and stable and powerful and capable of being the base of significant parts of the global economy.**](https://np.reddit.com / r / ethereum / comments / jvkoat / ama_we_are_the_efs_eth_20_research_team_pt_5_18 / gcprfwj/?utm_source = share&amp;utm_medium`

ec265,favor,Ethereum,`And Ethereum will still be profitable to mine , post EIP-1559 .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;I understand Ether is the coin that " powers " the Ethereum network ...`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`You deposit your ETH which they then use to run validators in batches of 32 ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`They offer a liquidity token , sETH2 , which can be used until the Phase 1.5 merge , at which point you can get ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH ( ~$35 ) 

 Do you have a source for this ?`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you ’re buying ETH and ERC-20 tokens , I would recommend buying directly in to a wallet ( a few allow for card payments ) , as this will avoid network fees and means you have full control over your coins .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has utility - people need to acquire it to use the network .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH issuance will further fall to ~0.5 % following the transaction to PoS , making deflation even more likely .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`FWIW you only need 32 ETH to run your own validator .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;The problem with this is they are making eth deflationary by stealing from every single user every time they make a transaction by not passing on the funds to the miners .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you already have ETH or BTC and you think another asset is going to * outperform * , then you can trade in the ‘ ratio ’ .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`So you would need ADA to perform better or the ADA / ETH ratio to increase .`

 & gt;Your comment looks like a very biased opinion towards Ethereum you got there for even linking Vitalik 's website for information regarding proof of stake in another comment .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 A quick run down of the top PoS chains : 

 • 	 ⁠ETH2 - 109,000 validators across 7 different clients , a mix of " data centres " and " hobbyists " 
 • 	 ⁠ADA - 1500 validators , 1 client , only " data centres " 
 • 	 ⁠DOT - 250 validators , 1 client , only " data centres " 
 • 	 ⁠EOS - 21 validators , 1 client , only " data centres " 
 • 	 ⁠BNB - 21 validators , 1 clown , CZ controlled 

 Only on ETH can an individual run their own validator and attest transactions themselves .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`It also does n’t preclude miners from saving ETH now and becoming validators in the future .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`These claim tokens would continue to operate on the PoS Ethereum chain , but be worthless on the fork chain .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 TL : DR ; The emergence of tokenized assets and Defi has made Ethereum ’s state unforkable .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`This will restrict supply and makes ETH a competitive store of value .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`As well as using 99 % less energy than PoW , it also makes Ethereum more secure .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`So while L2 solutions get implemented , they can work on integrating Ethereum further .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`I cited ETH scaling for a reason , as with sharding it essentially solves the blockchain trilemma - I ’m in that camp .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s also a mistruth to state it is more secure - Ethereum is fundamentally more secure .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s a function of the amount staked , so reduces with more ETH staked .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has functionality outside of staking and so there will be demand for it .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 I personally fail to see how ETH ’s initial distribution is vastly different to that of BTC .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 Also worth considering what people do with the asset - ETH is regularly used , whilst BTC is just held .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`You ’ve just listed all the use cases of ETH - you know , what makes it valuable .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`There are use cases that we have n’t yet discovered - that ’s not a narrative change , it ’s just something else that makes ETH fundamentally useful .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 This basically makes Ethereum dynamic and able to respond to unforeseen outside factors .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 32 ETH was chosen for a number of reasons , but it basically ca n’t be too small as otherwise it would potentially make the network less secure .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`This is purely in relation to ETH deposited in the deposit contract - it is not making reference to ETH held by exchanges that is not staked .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`ETH issuance with staking falls from 4.5 % to 0.5 % .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Ask yourself this - if BSC is capable of it , why does n’t Ethereum do it ? 

 Ethereum could be feeless tomorrow , but there is a reason it is not .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 * will * fix the fee issue - sharding is * the * scaling solution .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t forget about the ever increasing amount of Bitcoin that is wrapped - 1 % of supply is already on Ethereum and it ’s usage is securing the Ethereum network , not the Bitcoin network .`

 ETH is the native token to the Ethereum blockchain , but using smart contracts we can create other tokens on top of Ethereum .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin has Bitcoin , Ethereum has Ether , Dogecoin has Doge . 

 Blockchains are designed as such that if you want to use it , you need to pay a transaction fee .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Well for starters you only need 16 ETH to run an operating node on RocketPool , as the other 16 ETH is from other user deposits .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 You need 32 ETH to run your own validator , but you can join staking pools with as little as 0.01 ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 You just buy normal ETH and then come the merge ETH2 will be normal ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s likely that this would be achieved over time , however even just having very low inflation , no inflation , or slight deflation is very significant ( especially considering the underlying increase in demand i.e. a relatively stable supply , but increase demand will make ETH scarcer ) .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`You need 32 ETH to run your own validator , but you can join a staking pool with as little as 0.01 ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`There is a governance process in place for EIP ’s , and a firm hiring an ETH dev does not make them a core dev ...`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`If you think that CryptoKitties is still the extent of what Ethereum can do , you have 4 years of catching up to do .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`These loans are over collateralised ( 150 % ) , meaning you can borrow up to 66 % of the value of your ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`This means that the borrower can never default , as in the event the ETH price falls , the ETH that is held as collateral will be sold .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`This is why it ’s truly permissionless - you are in control and all you need is a wallet and some ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 You only need 16 ETH to run an operating node with RocketPool , otherwise staking pools from as little as 0.01 ERG .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`ETH / BTC is incredibly bullish at the moment , which means that ETH is likely to outperform BTC in the short term`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`21k is the default for an ETH send , which is why that was initially used .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is not a business - I ’m not sure why that it is relevant .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 The fact of the matter is that because Ethereum is so broad and diverse , you will never be able to succinctly summarise what is being done on it . dApp development is organised chaos - each day new use cases are being found that were previously unimaginable .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`What do you want to know more about ? 

 Short answer is that Ethereum intends to scale both L1 and L2 , so transaction fees will reduce .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`This is n’t true - ETH under PoS will be more secure`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`

 When ETH / USD increases all we are saying is that ETH is worth more in USD , or your USD buys you less ETH .`
ec265,favor,Ethereum,`There was a report sent out to clients - “ Why is ETH outperforming ? ”`

shst,favor,Ethereum,`well no one 's stopping you from aping into a ghostchain , just saying that ETH is crazily undervalued , not financial advice tho`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Just saying that if you ’re looking to be a DeFi degen but ca n’t afford ETH fees like most of us , L2 solutions like BSC , xDai or Polygon already exist .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Shilling ETH is like shilling a good trusty classic car that chugs a ton of gas , shilling ADA is like shilling a drawing of a cheap and fast car that looks nice .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Buying Ethereum now is like buying part of the internet in the 1990s`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Some ( long term ) bullish facts about Ethereum : 

 * With EIP-1559 planned for July , inflation on ETH could drop to 0 or even become negative depending on how utilized the network is , meaning ETH could become even better than BTC as a store of value 
 * With ETH2 's phase 1.5 planned for 2022 and roll ups expected by Q3 2021 , ETH will scale x10k , therefore gradually democratizing access to the network 
 * With new usecases , better UI ’s and new users onboarded , DeFi & amp ; NFT ’s will inevitably grow exponentially 

 Flippening seems inevitable within the next 5 years .`

shst,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is approaching $ 100k , L2 's are processing trillions of txs per day , a portrait of an alien cryptopunk has taken the Mona Lisa 's spot at the Louvre , Vitalik has uploaded his consciousness to Ethereum , and Cardano still does n't have smart contracts .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Few people understand that certain applications on Ethereum are unstoppable .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`

 I do n’t care about MATIC as an investment , I care about the network it supports , which scales Ethereum by a magnitude therefore allowing me to yield farm like a degenerate and ape into illiquid shitcoins without worrying about gas fees`

shst,favor,Ethereum,`Keeping moons in my reddit vault is like keeping ETH in cold storage .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`ETH fundamentals are looking insane and it 's been accumulating for a while now with BTC - ETH ratio looking super bullish .`

 I ’m roughly 100 % on ETH , but considering to stop dumping the MATIC I farm or swap it for nice DeFi coins that have good chances of beating ETH this cycle .`

shst,favor,Ethereum,`After the ETH2 merge , ETH ’s sell pressure ( amount of ETH miners / stakers need to sell to cover their costs ) will drop 90 % .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`If sell pressure drops 90 % and if demand for ETH goes up , stays the same or reduces less than 90 % , then numba go up for ETH`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Estimates based on current levels of network utilization point to 20k ETH burned /day or in other words , a 2 % annual supply decrease , meaning ETH will become deflationary .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Do n’t have to be an economic genius to know what that means for ETH holders .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m not professional but I believe in a “ super cycle ” for ETH , I do n’t even plan on selling as I used to do with the BTC I used to own before I went all in on ETH`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Or deposit ETH - WBTC get paid for it like 2 - 3 % , get paid to lend stablecoins another few % and farm with these stables on Alchemix for example .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`

 Do n’t you think that the fact people are willing to pay such high fees to use ETH network shows how great it is ?`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Also I believe ETH will flip BTC ’s mcap within 5 years`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`According to conservative [ estimates](https://docs.google.com / spreadsheets / d/1ZN444__qkPWPjMJQ_t6FfqbhllkWNhHF-06ivRF73nQ / edit#gid=0 ) , ETH supply peak would be under 120 M ETH before EIP-1559 makes it deflationary and decreases supply by 2 % annualy .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`What most do n't know is ETH will be the global financial settlement layer .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`Explaining Ethereum to friends :

 Me : Smart contracts allow you to interact with automated market makers , that ’s DeFi .`
shst,favor,Ethereum,`You can pool it with ETH on Uniswap and stake the LP token on indexcoop for like 20 - 40 % APY

 If not why would anyone even hold BTC ?`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has been going up steadily for the past 90 min , might try 2400 again .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`So far I ’m up a little over 100 % in three trades , ETH , LINK and ETH again .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is a very temping buy & lt;2400 , support may have just been found .`

RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to hit a new ATH`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Also I ’m trying to understand if there ’s a reason this would impact other crypto ’s ( ETH specifically ) , other than Bitcoin crash panic dragging the entire market down .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Glad to see my regular ETH doing well tho .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m currently building a 5 % ETH position and a 7.5 % BTC position , which I plan on doubling post bull market .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH going for 2900 , let ’s see if it gets there .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Once ETH eats up the 3 K wall we ’ll see what it ’s really made of`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Curious to see where ETH is at in a month , 4 K honestly seems likely`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I feel ETH dominance will only rise over the coming months`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 will change the game , I ca n’t wait .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n’t believe ETH dipped to 2 K around two weeks ago in the margin dip`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I feel ETH dominance will rise big time over the coming months`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 going prove of stake will be a game changer , I ca n’t wait .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I see a lot of comments about ETH still being undervalued , what would your fair value be ?`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I would n’t mind a 10 - 20 % ETH pullback , I ’d love to pick up some more on a discount .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH looks to be gaining momentum again , curious to see what happens once the Americans wake up .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH held up remarkably well after losing some of the momentum`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH might have another go at 3 K later today , this will be an interesting week .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Curious to see if ETH has another go at 3 K today , crossing it today would be crazy bullish .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Curious to see what happens to ETH dominance over time , I think we ’ll see 25 % by the end of the bull run .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH picking up some bullish momentum , would love to see the final push to 3 K today .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH approaching the ATH it set yesterday again , let ’s see if we hit 3 K this time .`

RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH dominance will to rise to 25 % this bull run I think , I feel it ’s still undervalued .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`To think ETH hit 2 K two weeks ago during the margin dip , what a steal lol .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH pumping again , let ’s see if it can get there`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH forming a small downward bullflag over the past hour , 3 K is coming .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH picking up some momentum again , let ’s see if we can hit 3 K tonight , only 1 % away .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s just 1 % ETH , you can do it .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH going again , let ’s see if it gets there .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to hit 3 K !`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s been great to see ETH seperate from BTC in terms of price movement .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Was waiting for a sunday dip on ETH yesterday , guess they ’re no more ?`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`With the current momentum I would n’t be surprised to see ETH hit 3.5 K this week`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH having another go at blasting pas 3100`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Was planning on buying ETH yesterday , should ’ve just done it instead of wait for a dip .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH absolutely flying , we could easily see 3300 today .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m fully expecting ETH dominance to be at least 25 % by the end of this bull run .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH dominance slowly rising to where it should be`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m guessing ETH rises to 3.5 K followed by a correction to 3 K and then steady climb to 4K.`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s see if ETH bounces of 3150 again , I do n’t think it ’s done running yet .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I love how ETH pumps while BTC stays put but BTC still drags ETH up if it goes on a run , double the ETH pumps !`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s see if ETH has more in the tank or if this was it for today , regardless I ’m happy .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I do n’t think ETH is done for today , 3300 seems rather likely .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH seems to have pretty solid support in the 2140s , another pump seems imminent .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Only a matter of time for ETH dominance to cross 25 % , I see it steadily rising through this bull run .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH having another go at 3200 , let ’s see how much is left in the tank .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m guessing BTC tops out at 200 K and ETH at 20K.`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I feel ETH dominance will rise through the rest of the bull market so I ’m interested in your perspective .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`To think ETH dropped to 2 K two weeks ago during the margin crash , what a ride .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s see if ETH will drop a bit , I ’d like to pick some more up on a discount .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has been bouncing of out little dips much better than BTC as of late .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m very bullish on ETH this week , I do n’t think it ’s done yet .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Solid bounce from ETH , curious to see what the rest of the day will look like .`

RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum keeps accelerating , I wonder where this rally will end .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I would n’t be surprised if ETH actually hits 4 K this week , the market is very bullish at the moment .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I think ETH dominance is still too low , curious to see how it processes over the coming months .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Although I feel ETH is still undervalued , the momentum of this rally is absolutely insane .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I am 100 % procent on team ETH is still undervalued , that said , there is no way this rally does n’t end with a pullback .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH not stopping , what rally so far .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH forming a mini wedge over the pas hour and a half , let ’s see if it goes for another pump .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH still looking bullish , I feel it has some more left in the tank .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH with another strong bounce , let ’s see how long this rally keeps up .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Surprising how small the dips have been on this ETH run , I do n’t think we ’re done yet .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I feel ETH dominance will only rise through the rest of this bull run , 10 K seems inevitable .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH looking bullish as ever , what a run so far , ca n’t wait to see where it ends up .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n’t believe ETH hit 3450 already`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Very curious to see what happens to ETH over the coming days .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Curious to see what happens to ETH over the coming hours .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Honestly , I would n’t mind ETH going for a correction , I ’d love to grab some more for a discount .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Very curious to see what happens to ETH over the coming days , this momentum has to go somewhere .`

RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to hit 3500`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is now only +13 % away from 4 K , this rally has been insane .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`This might turn into another margin crash , I ’m doubling my ETH position if it happens .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Lol that ’s basically what I ’m doing , ETH & gt ; THC .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Got my cash ready for if 3225 ETH support gives in`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH still looks very bullish , ca n’t wait to see what the rest of the week brings .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Watching ETH has been amazing`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Just woke up , great to see ETH hold so well after the run up .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Ca n’t wait to see what happens once ETH 2.0 rolls out`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH looking bullish , surprised how stable it ’s been given the magnitude of the run .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Still patiently watching ETH to load up if it dips`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH back at 3400 , let ’s see if it can keep this going .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Curious to see if ETH goes for 3500 again today , looking bullish right now .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Would n’t mind a nice pullback on ETH to load up , does n’t seem very likely ATM tho .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH looking good , let ’s see if it can keep the bullish momentum going .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`

 I personally hold 60/40 BTC / ETH , if you ’re holding both you ’re good for sure .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`BTC has it ’s advantages and so does ETH , especially once 2.0 comes out .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are the largest coins for a reason , ca n’t go wrong with holding both .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH pumping again , let ’s see if it has another go at 3500 .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH looking very bullish , 4 K this week is still on the table .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Even after the past 10 days I think ETH is still undervalued , I think we ’ll see 25 % ETH dominance this bull cycle .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH dips 25 % frequently , DCA’ing and buying those dips will make you more money than just DCA’ing .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I ’m curious to see whether ETH will eventually take over BTC in market cap , the proof of stake vs prove of work dynamic is fascinating .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Good to see ETH back above 3500 , let ’s see if it holds .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`To think ETH dipped to 2000 $ in the margin crash two weeks ago , what a bargin .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to hit a new ATH`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH still going strong , this run is quite the ride .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Set my buy order for potential dips on ETH and BTC but seems unlikely they hit , the market is crazy bullish right now .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is up 65 % in ten days and still pumping like it never happened .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH testing 3500 again , still on a solid upward trajectory after bouncing off support multiple times yesterday .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Good to see ETH at 3500 + again , it feels like it has more left in the tank .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH seems bound to go on another run this week , it ’s been crazy stable during during the pump .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH dominance bound to rise through the rest of this bull rally , I think we ’ll see 25 % by the end .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has hit an ATH every single day for 8 days straight , let ’s see if it extends the streak today .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`To the people giving me shit for saying ETH hit an ATH 9 days in a row , check the chart .`

RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`I feel ETH dominance is bound to rise through the rest of this bull run .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH hitting 5 K seems more likely than not at this point`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Ca n’t wait for ETH 2.0 , it will be fascinating to see how it plays out .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH gaining some steam again , 4 K is imminent .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`A months from now sub 4 K ETH will look like an absolute steal`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Loaded up on ETH during this little dip , I do n’t think this rally is over yet .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`To think ETH dipped to 2 K in the margin crash two weeks ago , what a fucking steal that was .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH going again , 4 K inbound .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH still looking bullish as ever .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Indeed it is , I loaded up on the dip today , ETH is the future .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Waking up to 4 K ETH on a monday is quite the start of the week , ca n’t wait to see what the rest of the week brings .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just keeps going , these past two weeks have been incredible .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH hitting not hitting 5 K this months seems unlikely at this point , the past two weeks have been insane .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH making it very difficult to not stare at graphs all day`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is consistently outperforming other currencies when the market ’s momentum goes downward , when other coins go down ETH stays flat .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is dominance is rapidly approaching 20 % , 19,1 % ATM .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s see if ETH holds 4 K`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s crazy how much ETH still gets shorted .`
RationalCrustacean,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to hit an ATH again`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`For me i m definitely selling as i have waited for 3 years and i bought at ATH .... im hoping to atleast break even and then ill cash out leaving some ETH and NEO incase they moon hard`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`I want to say that ETH is earthbound and it does n't want to moon but ETH prices are rising alot since last year`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`I feel that you can definitely invest into BTC , ETH and maybe NEO .... i do nt really trust other crypto guru advice since nobody really knows how the market will perform , maybe except some really big whales`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`Absolutely you should nt try to hold shitcoins .... you should hold good cryptos like BTC and ETH but you can gamble in other Alts if you really like them e.g Nano , Nonero , Neo etc`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`I thought he is using his hamster to power mining ETH`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`Buy BTC and ETH , keep your coins in cold storage and forget that you you bought any crypto ... and in 10 years boom 💥`

Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`Better to just invest in btc and eth or any other good crypto than diverging too much into stock and gold`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`Would be even funnier if its ETH or NEO ... it could say we are out of GAS`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`Its because most exchanges use tether as one of their trading pairs ... for now its easier that way but very less people will just buy tether as an investment like BTC or ETH`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`For me buying BTC and ETH is a saving in itself .... but to each his own`
Clash_My_Clans,favor,Ethereum,`If you are holding for 4 - 5 years BTC and ETH are solid investments ... will beat any alt in return and quite safe too`

sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Considering how active the ETH community is , with the constant development and innovation and with Eth 2.0 coming up , it is stupid not to hodl ETH`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I think the further the development of ETH progresses , with the Shards , POS , etc , the fees issue will get resolved and ETH should skyrocket , I mean its the most actively developed crypto project that I am aware of .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I mean , ETH is looking forward to converting to Proof Of Stake soon with ETH2.0 , so in " near future " , ETH mining would n't exist anyway .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; buying or selling moons right now is very fucked up 

 & gt ; Of course , you can either wait for a new way of exchanging to come up , or you can wait a few years for Ethereum 2.0 so the fees disappear .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is not available on the other headphones on the internet and then we can always make me a list of the year of experience`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`There is a long way where you convert Moons to xMoons , xMoons to xDai , xDai to Dai and then Dai to whatever you want , but its long and ETH fees costly , you can search for it in the subreddit there are many posts .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Future is bright , Ethereum bois just need to HODL`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH and keep rest 40 for Alts , there are some popular options here like Ada , Dot , Atom , XLM , LTC etc , you can split the 40 up between some of them after reading up on them a little bit .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I feel like Alts should be a personal decision , BTC / ETH are safe coins .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH pretty strong compared to its usual reactions on BTC drop , me approve .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't know about any such update but the main Ethereum related updated expected this month is Optimism which is an L2 solution to solve the gas fees issue .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I meant to write ETH than BTC , wrote ETH and BTC for some reason lol , I need to go to bed .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`You trade your Moons for xMoons , trade xMoons for xDai , and then trade xDai for Dai , and Dai exists on Ethereum Mainnet , you can trade it on any exchange .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`This is rather long and expensive in terms of ETH Gas fees , but since the fees are flat , this the way to got if you are trading a lot of moons .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`8th March Asian here , ETH hits 1800 , BTC hits 52k`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I doubt anyone has the balls to trash talk ETH .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Short term : I wish I did n't turn most of my Nano to ETH literally yesterday 

 Long term : I do n't mind`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Some would argue they should have bought more ETH :)`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 is coming and its coming fast , it will convert the whole network to PoS by next year and fees will be solved .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Take your time ETH , we know you get your ATHs after BTC , you stay strong`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd expect BTC to get a new ATH before ETH does , as is transition`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`BTC got its ATH , which means ETH should reach its ATH in ~1 - 2 days .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`This is what happens when Reddit partners up with Ethereum`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`u / Ok - Entrepreneur772 said 1 week ago [ that if ETH does n't reach 2000 by EOW he 'll eat his wallet ] .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`And there it is , Bitcoin decides to go down a little bit and ETH is like yeah okay time to dump`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Short method : [ moon.nano.trade](https://moon.nano.trade ) ( Costs like ~10 % fees I think ) ( Check their stats page tho , sometimes they run out of Nano ) 

 Long method : Search for trade moon posts here , there are many , but the method is long and ETH fees will kill you unless you have a ton of moons`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Good Good ETH , I like what I 'm saying , now continue this`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Greyscale also invests in Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash , which someone did 10 mins on basic research on , would immediately sell .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`So moons reside on the Ropsten Testnet of Ethereum , if you send them to your Metamask wallet , they will appear in the Ropsten Testnet tab(you'll have to manually add the token ) .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Honeyswap lives on the xDai network , so you 'll have to swap moons to xMoons then xMoons to xDai on honeyswap and then xDai to Dai which is on the Ethereum network , and you can swap it or move to an exchange .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Okay yes sure , ETH is not built for and ca n't be used for sending $ 5 for a beer , but first of all , an ETH transaction does n't cost $ 71 .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Well I was there son , I watched ETH reach 2k for the 2nd time before it never went below again`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I feel sad for the people whose stop losses were triggered due to the mini ETH dip`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I bought my first ETH at 2k lol , then brought my average buy price drastically down by buying the dips`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`That does n't make sense , BNB does n't exist or have a pegged token on Ethereum network , there should n't be a ERC20 option .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Boy the real ETH value is way more than what its being shown anywhere right now`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Thank you ETH for giving my portfolio a new ATH !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`What do you guys expect the price of BTC and ETH to be exactly 1 year from now ? ! RemindMe 1 year`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Have we established whether ETH is a he or a she ?`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Some guy just put an ETH buy order at $ 500 on Binance , call me optimistic but I doubt we 're hitting 500 in the next bear market , what do you guys think the floor would be ?`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I believe we hit $ 88 ETH last year march .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I have Attack on Titan Epic music playing while watching ETH charts , definitely fits .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Let BTC slide , ETH / Alt season comes when BTC rests`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum : The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just break 2100 already I need to work aswell`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`On a decent exchange like Binance the buying fees would be less than $ 1 . 

 Second , ETH transactions do n't cost this much , smart contracts cost high .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`If someone needs a daily dose of cringe , here 's the Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik rapping and dancing : [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7MeJionPMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7MeJionPMA ) 

 Edit : Vitalik do be spittin ' fire tho`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Holy shit lets go ETH 2088 , lets test 2100 ! ! !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Also , many people love Ethereum for the tech itself , no " killer " will honestly ever kill it , it feels great when great tech sees the gains aswell`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just does n't wanna stop already goddamn , do you guys think we can hit 2200 ?`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Because Binance asks you extra withdrawal fees upward of 0.008 ETH , which is like 8x what a transaction costs .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Wait why .. Reddit Vault is a just an Ethereum Wallet , you could just send moons to another Ethereum wallet supporting Rinkeby Network`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Unless you 're buying 32 ETH to be able to run a node , having 0.9 ETH or 1 ETH does n't really make a difference`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I doubt both can happen at the same time , BTC needs to be stable for ETH to move unfortunately`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Looks like ETH moving towards new ATH again !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm a developer , take it from me , the metric is kinda pointless , plus the way its framed as well , Cardano beats Polkadot and Ethereum in number of commits , like its a big thing .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 True Ethereum fans do n't try to defend the fees , we agree its an issue .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`While in this very thread someone mentioned Cardano does n't have smart contracts or dapps yet and two shiller popped out , one literally said that s untrue lol , and one said ETH2 does n't have dapps either , which does n't make sense , ETH = ETH2 , its just a protocol change which literally does n't change anything for any dapp .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Any one can come and fork Ethereum and increase the transaction cap to make it scalable , but that would come at the price of decentralization and we 're not in favour of that . "`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 https://twitter.com/milanavalmont/status/1379482882750754816?s=19 

 ETH transfers do nt take more than $ 6 - 7 fee even at peak traffic 

 These people make fake tweets , CZ(Binance CEO ) shares them and replies to them , uninformed investors buy into this , call ETH a joke , its developers idiots , and start chanting BNB will flip ETH .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is one of the few smart contracts network trying to solve gas fees issues without compromising on decentralization and is getting delayed because how much of a technical challenge it is , and getting bashed for it , because they did n't just take the easy BSC route and compromised decentralization for low fees .`

sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`All I 'm saying is , if Cardano was ' killing ' Ethereum any time soon , they would wait for release and let their project do the talking .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Instead their founder has spent last 4 years uploading videos and giving interviews just explaining how Cardano is better than Ethereum and how Cardano will overtake Ethereum .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`While Ethereum is just an open source foundation , they research and write tech , let their software do the talking .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 This is also one of the reasons Cardano 's founder mentioned he left Ethereum .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`u / DeeDot11 my yesterday 's prediction is almost here lmao , 64k BTC already happened , 2400 ETH about to happen`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Loving the ETH party , wish I loaded up on some VET last DCA , oh well`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin stop where you are please , you need to slide for ETH to hit 2500`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`People who think that Ethereum forking off to a new chain after the hack is not the way crypto should work .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`You can just view the ETH / BTC chart anywhere , probably Coinbase will have the longest timespan of data`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`USDT withdrawal fee is high on most platforms , the issue is due to the explosion in Ethereum gas prices .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin is deflationary and can be used as a store of value , Ethereum is quite literally digital oil , it powers DeFi and will power any kind of decentralization in the future , and with EIP-1559 it will be deflationary aswell .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`So when we 're looking at adoption , its way easier to have money flow into Bitcoin and Ethereum compared to Doge , the way money flows into Doge is by attracting and shilling unaware newbies and putting them together with the delusional community that is r / dogecoin`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`So with that in mind , Ethereum is a general purpose blockchain , which understands a programming language , so when someone runs the code from this language on the network(this code is known as a smart contract ) , it is run and verified by every person on the network , so decentralizing anything that you can code .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum does n't have a specific usecase , anyone and everyone can come and use the network to fulfill their usecase by coding up a smart contract !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`A very simple explanation of Ethereum to newbies , who are slightly familiar with Bitcoin : 

 Satoshi when making Bitcoin was like , Why do n't we completely decentralize our payment systems , you know cut the intermediaries , make people sole owner of their money , yada yada yada ...`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`So with that in mind , Ethereum is a general purpose blockchain , which understands a programming language , so when someone runs the code from this language on the network(this code is known as a smart contract ) , it is run and verified by every person on the network , so decentralizing anything that you can code .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum does n't have a specific usecase , anyone and everyone can come and use the network to fulfill their usecase by coding up a smart contract !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH was pretty quick to go from 1950 to back to 2100`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Few months back , my first ETH buy was at $ 2000 , the literal top for quite a while back then , initially I felt stupid , but slowly I realized , if I believe in the project long term , these local tops do n't mean shit .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Watching ETH move like a king last week was amazing`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Who would 've thought 2 months ago that today 2100 ETH would be a dip`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 is just a underlying protocol change to the network , your tokens would n't be affected , you wo n't have to worry about anything .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Gas Fees are a major issue for Ethereum right now but your withdrawal issue is more from Exchanges being greedy than from the network .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT usecase from what Doge / BTC do .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`  Lately there have been talks of doing bus ticketing and stadium ticketing through NFTs on Ethereum , Ethereum also powers DeFi , completely removing banks and exchanges through decentralized lending platforms and automated market makers .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`You ca n't just compare two different usecases , Ethereum is not built for you to pay with ETH at starbucks , and it never will be that way .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Is it like having to run a   ETH2 Staking Node just with a smaller minimum ETH amount ?`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`  is supportive of increasing the ETH gas limit moderately to 15 M aswell !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Nooo ETH wait for my DCA before hitting 3k please :(`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`mfw my Nano deposit finally came through and its time to buy more ETH lets go baby`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`What % are you guys earning by staking ETH on Kraken ?`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`When I stake on ETH on Kraken , it says " Grow Rewards " is OFF , meaning that rewards I get from staking will NOT be added to staking .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH transfers do n't cost as much still , Kraken / Gemini only take 0.001 ETH .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`If exchanges like Binance are asking 0.008 ETH or KuCoin asking 0.01 ETH , that 's the exchange being greedy !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I love ETH but you should do your full research before trusting internet strangers with your cash !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone who comes here saying they are new and talk about shit like doge or safemoon , I always tell them to move away from it , go with BTC / ETH to start with , most shitcoins will get dumped very hard in the long run if not short run .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`My first ETH buy was at 2000 , the literal top back then , it dropped immediately .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Hi , I initiated staking my ETH on Kraken yesterday , but its still ' confirming ' , how long does it to take for it to confirm and start staking ?`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`How to get more ETH : BETH is what Binance gives you 1:1 when you stake your ETH with them .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`What s cool is that BETH / ETH trading pair is already available on Binance and instead of 1:1 , its being traded at 0.94:1 !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Hey guys I just wrote a post on how you can get more ETH than you already have on Binance , through their BETH staking disparity : https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvykr5/the_beth_disparity_how_you_can_get_more_eth_than/ 

 Do check it out if you 're planning to stake and hold on Binance .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I have no idea , is Binance US even letting you stake ETH ? 

 Anyway , I 've heard nothing but bad things about Binance US , it maybe better to switch to Kraken / Coinbase and stake there`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`BETH * is * Binance 's token that signifies you are staking ETH .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`But I imagine you 'd still be staking using BETH and can swap back to ETH when you want to trade .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 BSC went this route , massively increased gas limit so they have super low fees , but they have only 21 total validators now , making the chain waay insecure compared to Ethereum .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Holy hell ETH 2500 I just noticed lets gooo ! ! !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH Gas fees are high yes , but those are costs for executing smart contracts , they cost a lot .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Wow ETH broke 2600 quick , already up and not going below , LETS GO !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`* The ETH 2.0 Merge can be thought of as replacing the engine of an airplane while it is still flying .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 So with the recent EIPs and upgrades to Ethereum , people believe there has been a boost in security such that we can afford a moderate increase in gas limit without much insecure effects , thus they did it .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`London Hardfork is a an upgrade to the Ethereum Network , involving imporvements like EIP-1559 , which aims to make ETH deflationary by burning some of the transactions fees , and other things like stabilizing gas fees by introducing a base fee concept .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Just noticed Binance lowered their ETH withdrawal fee to 0.005 !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH at 2500 that s what I like to see baby !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't know what worries me more , the fact that their reddit account was created today morning , or the fact that they bought leverage positions instead of buying actual ETH .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH showing its true king form again , come on baby , lets break that 2700`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`32 + ETH -&gt ; run your own staking node , see the official ethereum guide on it 

 Decent amount but & lt;32 -&gt ; wait for rocketpool , decentralized staking pool 

 & lt;1 ETH -&gt ; Exchanges , but make sure you trust the exchange and see their admin fees , thus I went with Kraken`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum itself has updates lined up to improve scalability since these high fees are due to the massive increase in traffic .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just randomly gets a new ATH what was that 15 m candle jeez lets gooo`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Minting on Binance 's chain will be very cheap compared to minting on Ethereum .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Most whales or buyers exist on Ethereum network anyway , the top platforms like OpenSea , Mintable etc all are on Ethereum .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`OpenSea is also launching their platform on Matic(already in beta ) , which is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution , and there I think it will cost you like a cent to mint your NFT , so consider trying that instead of trying on BSC .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`L2 Ethereum Solutions will be the key moving forward , Matic is the top L2 solution right , seeing a boom in traffic as well as adoption .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I feel like Ethereum L2 solutions will be key going forward , but I do n't know any more than Matic(Polygon ) or Stake(xDai ) , please enlighten me on some L2 projects .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Another ATH for ETH today , what a beast , we might even hit 2800 today or tomorrow , this * is * the tsunami , this decoupling is amazing !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Upto you , I 'm holding ETH long term , some do n't hold at all and call it dead .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 Matic is like a separate network yes but it essentially uses the security of the Ethereum Network , its not a side chain , its a commit chain , check out videos of Finematics on youtube , he explains it well .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I believe Ethereum will probably not flip Bitcoin but this will be like the last reason for it .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin may exist as a store of value with its utility of payments being barely used while Ethereum may exist as this massive network of interacting dApps and Contracts , embedded into our lives or being used internally by companies in apps we have no idea about .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`I bought ETH at 1300 - 1400 but still ca n't beat the FOMO of not buying more at these prices`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`༼   つ   ◕ \ _ ◕   ༽つ eth take my energy`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Oh man only a few weeks ago with dipped to 1300 , and now we 're battling 3100 , what a time to be alive , what a beast ETH & lt;3`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`But I guess the price will lower a little bit since many people only focused on Ethereum .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Oh my goodness ETH , what do you guys think maybe the top this run where you feel uncomfortable enough to take a bit of profit ?`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH you are so disgusting I love you`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`PLEASE do nt buy ETC , just search on the sub , there are many posts explaining what Ethereum Classic is .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 3700 EOD that s what I like to see !`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 Here 's a code if you want it to speak at a milestone , for example for ETH , this code will speak when ETH hits 3700 .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`NOO , Ethereum Classic is not Ethereum , please avoid it all costs .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Its definitely not future proof , even Vitalik says even with PoS and Sharding , Layer 2 solutions is where it will be at , dapps and ecosystem will be built on Layer 2 protocols like Rollups which will use the base Ethereum layer for security .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`This maybe my bias but I do n't see why they ca n't pull it off , if anything , in this industry , the Ethereum Foundation and devs are the most trusted set of people .`
sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`Binance([Link](https://twitter.com / binance / status/1391690507735142402 ) ] :

sggts04,favor,Ethereum,`

 Looks like people are withdrawing their ETH and Binance does n't have enough liquidity , although I swear they do this like every other week lol .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`As well as which projects ( excluding the major ones , BTC , ETH , ADA , VET , etc . ) do you see getting the most adoption within 5 - 10 years ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Slow start , but ETH 2.0 is too important to fail , I have a feeling Vitalik will do / say whatever he has to in order to get it off the ground`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Yeah there 's a lot of misinformation out there , and even what I told you could be subject to change ( you never know with Vitalik and ETH 2.0 ) .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`But he is also very self - aware , and if the current rewards and set - up for ETH 2.0 deposits are too unattractive , he is intelligent enough to know he would have to tweak them to be more tasteful`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Being honest , other blockchains are n't going to be aiming at taking ETH down , as it is a vital part of our ecosystem and is here to stay for the foreseeable future .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`ETH boys got ta learn that we 're in this together !`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You could buy back in and get more ETH in your stack , that is only if the price does n't continue going up though`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It 's a joke just as ETH 2.0 was a joke , and look at what we have now .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Because the Ethereum network ca n't possibly handle mass amounts of traffic due to the fee issue which wo n't be fixed for quite some time .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Most of those who are staking their eth believe in the project and its future , and do not let the risks stop them from making their decisions`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`If that 's the case , I 'll be expecting ETH to be # 1 for me .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Some do n't consider Ether to be an altcoin either , but to each their own .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 All things require time ; Just recently everyone still joked about " ETH 2.0 when ? "`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`*  
 & gt ;  
 & gt;When it comes to supporting other crypto assets , Sandler says Ethereum is currently on the road map , along with support for staking – although a launch date has not been set .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It puts you at a disadvantage , so I would expect us to build up those services once we can support Ethereum .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`They said that they can not give a date right now , but that support for ETH staking is " definitely on the roadmap " .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,` 
 & gt ;  
 & gt;Another big feature is that you will not be limited to only send assets to users / addresses already on Loopring ’s L2 , but to * any * Ethereum address at all !`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I agree that OP definitely needs to put more into BTC , maybe take 10 % off ETH and throw that into alts and make BTC like 40 % or 50 % .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`These other blockchains ( DOT , ADA , SOL , AVAX ) are all competing to become the top # 2 right now , as we know with the way development works ( it takes ages to be done right ) we wo n't have too many L2 ETH projects in the short - term , so congestion in L1 causes the fees to rise , requiring alternative options to the Ethereum network itself , as too much traffic in one place is not fun for anyone involved .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Also hopefully other chains can start becoming what the Ethereum network is right now , we need alternatives with interoperability`

 * ETHE , a vehicle for investors to gain exposure to ether ( [ ETH ( ETH , -3.52%)](https://www.coindesk.com / price / ethereum ) ) , the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain , currently has   29.5 million shares outstanding with each share representing ownership of 0.09284789 ETH .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm not entirely sure how the price is correlated , but in the article is says the shares are up 350 % YTD , and they attributed that to the fact that ETH itself is up 350 % YTD , so take that for what you will .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`There is no ETH killer , but if you do n't think ADA is undervalued at it 's current price , then I do n't know what to tell you .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`People do n't need to confuse ETH and BTC like they have the same goal in mind , their goals could n't be further apart from one another`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`This is why we can not compare the Ethereum network , and the single crypto that is BTC .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 & gt;“You could swap your collateral from [ LINK ( LINK , +2.04%)](https://www.coindesk.com / price / chainlink ) to AAVE , from ETH to YFI , ” Aave CEO Stani Kulechov explained over Zoom .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I assume you feel the same way about DOT and ETH as well then ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`They are planning on introducing staked pairs next year , but until then all staked ETH is locked`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Here is the current price of bricks and where you can track them : 

 [ https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick ) 

 The way to sell them is pretty complicated for someone who has no knowledge of how these things work , as you 'd have to bridge your bricks over to the xdai testnet and sell them on HoneySwap , and that would require you purchasing multiple other currencies as well as getting testnet ETH from the faucet .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`As far as the ETH Network taking over goes , I would say that 's one of the least likely scenarios as each day passes , the competitors to ETH get closer to where they need to be in order to make some sort of splash in the space .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`The Ethereum Network will more than likely always be # 1 , but I 'm sure there will be a time when 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . are either able to work alongside one another , or when # 2 or # 3 wo n't seem like such a bad alternative compared to # 1 , as it will become a matter of personal preference`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Basically there are testnets being put up soon where people will be able to write code for Cardano dapps , as well as Ethereum dapps that will run on Cardano 's chain , but more efficiently than being in F1 .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`He hopes for $ 400 ETH , people here need to stop acting like there 's a " right " way to talk about crypto .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`If you staked your ETH now on Kraken it becomes ETH2 , and it 'll be locked up until Kraken introduces the ETH2 trading pairs that will allow you to trade your staked assets .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I believe you need to have ETH in your wallet to pay the gas to enter and exit the pools , as I am not sure if they take the fees out of the pooled amount of not .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`This is all I got 

 & gt;As per the [ announcement](https://consensys.net / blog / press - release / metamask - early - adopter - program - enables - institutional - access - to - defi/ ) , the upgraded version is aimed at “ trading firms and crypto custodians ” and will provide them with “ institutional - grade features , ” including the ability to “ swaps tokens , borrow , lend , and invest in Ethereum applications . ”`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I am too worried about a massive run happening within that timeframe and having my ETH locked up would mean that I would n't be able to capture any of those gains .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`That would make it all the better , but I get it since they require a minimum amount of ETH to remain staked in the contract .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`BTC being the # 1 for most ; If you 're interested in network tokens like ETH I would recommend ADA , and for privacy coins I 'd recommend you check out XMR , BEAM , and PIVX .`

 & gt;ETHtz tokens went live on the Tezos mainnet December 12 , allowing Tezos users to trade native tokens pegged to the price of ETH , according to a post from Wealthchain CEO Kevin Mehrabi .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 People need to realize that the Ethereum Network by itself is not at all what we need / deserve in this space .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`ETH devs getting the ability to build more efficient projects on Cardano is absolutely what advancement of the space looks like , and hopefully other projects get to this point as well .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Most will recommend keeping a majority ( probably at least 80 % ) in BTC and ETH , and dividing the rest of it amongst whatever alts you believe in .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I do n't believe the best argument to be made is that it is " better than ETH " , but that it can be another very large blockchain in the DeFi / crypto world in general .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`On Cardano there is no priority for Native ADA tokens , meaning that all erc-20 as well as others that can run on Cardano are cheaper to send considering they wo n't be made a secondary priority as they are on Ethereum .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I 'll admit I recently rebalanced from about 40 % ETH 40 % BTC to what I have currently .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Anyone who has common sense knows that there will never be an ETH killer , but there has yet to be the big # 2 identified when it comes to smart contract platforms .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Should I swap what GRT I have left over into ETH now ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`And I say this as someone who holds most of their portfolio in ADA at the moment ; There are just too many unknowns for me to recommend swapping your ETH for ADA , considering the Ethereum Network is all ready a working product , and they launched phase 0 seamlessly .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`ADA was the first alt I had my eyes on acquiring after ETH , it just took me a bit longer to get the chance .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I never once said that Ethereum is perfect , I said it 's better in * today 's state * than Cardano .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It all depends on if ETH can finally get through that 670 wall`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`In its history ETH has always outperformed BTC in January , but there are never any guarantees so we really do n't know what 's going to happen .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`And some of y all hated on me for swapping .6 ETH for ADA !`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Only projects build on the Ethereum blockchain , for right now at least`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Then it goes ETH , but from there it boils down to biases towards certain projects .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`But whatever protocol manages to become ETH 's biggest competitor is gon na be the best to invest in at this moment ; No one * knows * which one that will be , though`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You ca n't compare companies like Tesla to blockchains / networks like Ethereum , the fundamentals just are n't the same .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 is a multi - year project that still is only in phase 0 , the next phases are meant to take a minimum of 2 years to complete , in the meantime other projects we will never have heard of will pop up and introduce new mechanisms to the space .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 ETH is a gem for sure , it will always lead the DeFi sector for sure , unless something catastrophic occurs .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`
 As for the ETH killer / Tesla killer argument , there really is n't anything similar as most of the Tesla argument comes down to it being overvalued ; That has nothing to do with the potential for a new competitor to come into the space and undercut them .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`The more of a following ETH gets , the more expensive it gets to use the network , the more incentives people have to use other networks .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`The reasons for people flocking to mp3 players over a cd are not for the same type of reasons why people would choose an ETH competitor over ETH .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Because the original topic at hand had nothing to do with the technological differences between the two ( Tesla / Tesla killers , ETH / ETH killers ) .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`
 The original point was that while Tesla does have so - called " tesla killers " , to compare those to the ETH killers would not be a fair comparison , if your sole reason for the comparison is " technology needs to improve "`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I 'm not saying I am all in on Cardano , I hold ETH and plan on picking up some XTZ as well when the time is right .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Are we expecting the ETH / BTC ratio to get near ATH this time around ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I believe that there are too many other smart contract platforms with too much going on though this time around for money to just keep pouring and pouring into ETH .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Attempting to do what Cardano is doing is by no means an easy feat , and they are designing things with scalability at the forefront rather than it be an afterthought , like what happened with Ethereum .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I think ETH doubling is more likely at this very moment`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`People sold when BTC hit ATH again , so I can only assume the same will happen when ETH does`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Not sure , I would say he could be even more busy than Musk considering Ethereum would not be the same without Vitalik involved .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`My sister 's fiancé just messaged me , saying everyone on Facebook is talking about Ethereum .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`For .45 ETH you can get whatever you want`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Yes , however much you are in profit on BTC would be taxed , the purchase of the ETH itself is n't taxed .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Not till ETH sets a new ATH does alt season truly begin`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`And I remember a time when people were saying they were n't gon na get the 500,000 ETH required for the contract`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 For ETH , it is a network in which other cryptocurrencies can build off of , making it akin to the " internet of crypto " so to speak .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It 's a privacy coin , it 'll run when people are wanting to move their profits from BTC / ETH etc . and keep them private .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`As someone who has only used Uniswap , being able to swap ETH for USDC and only pay .20 cents , and have my swap go through instantly , it really shows you where DEXs are headed in the future .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 ETH has had quite the head start , this year and next the other platforms will start to shine as well`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Devs from ETH will be able to write contracts for Cardano and seamlessly port them over using their KEVM .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Personally , I 'm thinking profits need to be taken before the ETH futures go live , because that could potentially have quite the impact on the alt market at the very least .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You 're buying ETH someone is selling you , so I do n't think one small transaction moves the marketcap at all`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`People are actually convinced that Ethereum will be the only chain to make it .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You should 've put the majority into ETH , but I suppose this will be as good a lesson as any to learn at the start !`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You have n't even given ETH a chance to show what it 's gon na do !`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I could be wrong , but it feels like they just have a ETC trust because it is related to ETH itself , and they thought some fools would buy the " cheaper Ether "`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I do n't think LTC will ever pass ETH as this point considering it is thought of as Bitcoin 's " little brother " , but it does have some interesting advancements being made with their LIPs .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`[ Loopring](https://exchange.loopring.io / swap / ETH - LRC ) has been going hard when it comes to adding more pairs .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 [ https://exchange.loopring.io/swap/ETH-DAI](https://exchange.loopring.io/swap/ETH-DAI ) 

 This will be your cheapest option when it comes down to going from ETH - DAI`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It has only been 5 years\ * plus , imagine hating on a project that 's gon na allow Ethereum developers to run their smart contracts on it cheaper and faster`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Anyone who mentions anything other than BTC or ETH comes off as a shill to these people , you 're all good in my book .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`That is a conclusion you 're coming to on your own , in no way did they say that the bake - off directly led to them partnering with the Ethereum Foundation .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`They have n't said anything else about how Reddit and the Ethereum Foundation plan on working with one another`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`If those numbers are ever reached , it would either be a massive bubble of the likes we have n't seen before , or it would be decades in the future , assuming our society utilizes the ETH network in their daily lives .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Sometimes Reddit runs out of testnet ETH , so it takes them time to refill .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Some think it 'll even be bigger then ETH`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Cardano does n't even have smart contracts right now , so to think they 're the biggest immediate threat to ETH is kinda crazy imo .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`ADA is my # 1 holding , but I fully believe that ETH will always be the top smart contract platform .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I do n't recall anyone saying that ETH was done ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`The issue is that there is n't a chain out there that has a comparable ecosystem to Ethereum .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`As opposed to Ethereum who are now trying to transition from a POW concept to POS , as well as working on implementing sharding , which has a high chance of not getting released on time as that 's a lot to overhaul .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You 're right it is the opposite of ETH , but only in the sense that Cardano decided to opt for building up the perfect foundation first , THEN focusing on the pillars that will support their ecosystem .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`As opposed to ETH who is in the process of completely renovating their current foundation of being a POW concept without sharding .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`No one can attack what Cardano is building because it is superior to ETH .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Ether reserves on centralized exchanges have also [ plunged significantly](https://btcmanager.com / analyst - ether - eth - new - ath - reserve - exchanges/ ) of late , and analysts have predicted that the price of ether may see further increase in the coming months .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Only BTC and ETH have the power as of right now .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`The issue with ETH is that it is n't thought of as a SoV , and no company is gon na adopt a blockchain with the fee issue that they have .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`So , you 're telling me you lost 1 whole ETH for ~5 % gains in bnb ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It 's one of the only real - world examples we have of sharding right now , something ETH is working on implementing in the next 1 - 2 years`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It 's likely their way of pushing ETH and BTC shares`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`There 's far too much volume on ETH for everyone to leave , there are thousands upon thousands of dapps out there right now .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 ETH is POW right now , but transitioning to POS , so if you stake ETH right now for ETH2.0 , you are locking your ETH2.0 up for at a minimum of 1 - 2 years .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It 's undoubtedly going to have low fees , the true determining factor will be what kind of dapps are launched on their chain , as well as how many dapps on Ethereum are going to make the transition over to Cardano`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Just make sure you have enough ETH for gas fees`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`And many of those smart contract platforms have n't the team or the ideals to deal with massive amounts of traffic , so it 'll really be interesting to see who pulls some of the attention off of ETH this year .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Well I hold much more ETH than I do both of those , plus ATOM is attacking a different problem than ETH is , so I find it hard to compare the two .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`UNI wo n't be even close to as big as BNB , it still is stuck with the same issues as the rest of the ETH protocols`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Reminds me just how terrible ETH actually is right now`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`They are n't gon na go away for awhile , but there 's a reason most protocols are being built as PoS concepts , and there 's a reason ETH is working on transitioning from PoW to PoS`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`But only stake if you 're comfortable with not moving your ETH for 1 - 2 years`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`The return is relative to what the ETH network is doing , so it is kind of hard to figure out what your constant APY is gon na be on average .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It will never be the same price as ETH , the supply wo n't allow for it .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Then you might as well just send your ETH to your MM address straight from those exchanges themselves , there would n't be any sense in forcing yourself to pay extra fees just to put your crypto all in one place before sending it to MM`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It may never get the massive ecosystem that ETH has built , it might have fatal errors in the code that have yet to be exploited .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`The fact of the matter is that ETH still has a much brighter future long - term than BTC does`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I would put my money on ETH still being around , though .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`First , what is the cause for you considering ditching all your ETH ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`ETH 2.0 will come , it 's just a matter of when`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`If they 're investing in ETH , they 're putting their money on ETH 2.0 , so it would make the most sense for them to wait to actually see what Serenity looks like in action before making a move such as that .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Alts tend to run together , so I do n't see how ETH running up would cause ADA to fall`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I think the 3 chains that will remain in that time are gon na be ETH , ATOM , ADA .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It 's the same thing with the ETH network , anyone can issue a token if you 're capable enough .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Plus they have the KEVM , which will allow ETH developers to easily port over their contracts to Cardano .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Care to explain how ETH is so much better ?`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You wo n't have to do anything , it 's just ETH transitioning to Layer 2 , and from a POW concept into a POS`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`It 's only gon na go up because of ETH fees`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`To answer your question though , I do think PoS is going to be a lot more relevant to new projects in the future , and I believe we 're all ready seeing that start today with how many quality projects there are that are PoS , and we all know that ETH is making the transition for a reason .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`You have ETH , DOGE , ETC , BTC , VGX , there are n't many " big " names in the space left that still use PoW , and we all know what happens with ETC so that one is just an example of why you would n't wanna do a PoW consensus mechanism .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`

 ETH making the transition is just putting the nail in the coffin for any new project to be PoW`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Ideally , the company wants everyone to " totally love " ETH`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I have issues even thinking about buying ETH at 2k , that 3k is absolutely out of the question`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Even thinking BTC and ETH are going to continue surviving , to me , is not a belief anyone should hold , especially considering how terrible the tech for BTC actually is .`

GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`Saying ETH is a good buy below $ 4k like BTC was a good buy under $ 4k is now a fair comparison lol .`
GoldenRain99,neither,Ethereum,`I do n't mean it will be done perfectly , I mean that the future of ETH and its ecosystem absolutely rely on the transition over to ETH 2.0 , and any roadblocks that get thrown in the way are going to have very unfortunate effects on it as a whole .`

 The wealth distribution of Ethereum is known to be extremely centralized ; the PoS staking set will be likewise .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 I said : 

 & gt ; The wealth distribution of Ethereum is known to be extremely centralized 

 You responded with 

 & gt ; Actually that is n't true .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Here 's some research : https://www.clovr.com/page/crypto-whales/ 

 For comparision , the Gini index for countries in the world : https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/SI.POV.GINI/rankings 

 Note that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have worse Gini Coefficients than the countries in the world with the * most * wealth centralization .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`This is what I said : 

 & gt ; The wealth distribution of Ethereum is known to be extremely centralized 

 You made the assumption that I was talking about it being relative to ... something .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  I do n't see how your decision to buy Ether has any relevance on that . 

 & gt ; That 's another way to write ' it 's obviously true and I do n't know how to respond ' .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 This assumes the Ethereum required to take this level of control over the network is not * already * in the hands of those people , which means the money is already committed to the purpose .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Yeah , I said both , because they 're both true ? 

 The wealth distribution is centralized already , and will only become moreso due to the mechanics of Ethereum 's specific PoS implementation .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 This bias means you 'll see the same kind of wealth centralization in Ethereum as you have seen hashrate centralization amongst miners on Bitcoin , for analogous reasons .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 I do n't know that being unable to withdraw ETH makes any significant difference at all if the goal is not " accumulate the most dollars now " , but is instead " control the transaction layer for future profit potential . "`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 You have a pretty easy way of confirming this : just look at how many genesis wallets still hold significant balances ( i.e. thousands of Ether or more ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  In Ethereum , the distribution is exceptionally poor , meaning control over the network is already in the hands of the wealthiest ( in terms of Ether , not in terms of dollar value ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Or is it a general principle ? 

 This basically boils down to " PoS on Ethereum is just canonicalizing plutocracy at the protocol level " .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  There 's a number of problems with Ethereum 's PoS , not the least of which is the wealth distribution -- there 's also the problems of strong bias of currency flow from non - stakers to stakers , the lack of accountability / visibility into share of control ( the pseudonymity problem ) , and the problems that arise from griefing attacks coming from majority stakeholders .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The worst part about this is that any nation or corporation who thought Ethereum was either a risk or an opportunity could have loaded up back when Ether was pennies , and we can never know .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  The distribution of wealth among Ethereum holders is worse than the wealth distribution of the most unequal countries in the world ; therefore the distribution of stakers will be equally centralized .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  This directly contradicts your conclusion here that " PoS probably will be better in practice by lowering barriers to participation " , given that the price of 32 Ether * is * the barrier to adoption , and therefore must go down over time in order for that statement to be true .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The point is that 28,000 ETH a day is n't what caused the number to move from " half a million dollars " a week or two ago to " a billion dollars " ( aka doubling ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`43 % of the Ether in the deposit contract ( as of recently , may not be exactly current ) belongs to 10 depositors .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ;   People talk shit about Ethereum 's PoW consensus algorithm , but I think it was crucial to legitimize Ethereum .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Neither one is well decentralized ; but this means your original claim that " Ethereum is decentralized " is false , and you 've admitted that you agree with this by using whataboutism as a rebuttal .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  I see further down you were thinking about pooling with friends ... and yes , you could do that , but it would require pooling the Ether first , then staking it , and then tracking and managing the profits / losses by hand ( or with a spreadsheet or something ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 [ E ] Put differently : prove to everyone that this is n't just decentralization theatre like the vast majority of DAOs built on Ethereum .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The more expensive Ether becomes , the more expensive transactions ( as denominated in dollars ) become .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`If you need 2x10 ^ -4 Ether to pay for some transaction then yes , the barrier to entry to make that transaction goes up with the price .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`There 's no correlation between the two , meaning he was right : as the cost of Ether goes up , so too does the cost of a transaction , in dollars .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 The only way for this to not be true is of there were an inverse relationship between the Ether conversion rate and the cost of a transaction in Ether ( i.e. as Ether becomes more expensive , transactions cost less Ether to make ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Given that this is not true ( and has never been true ) , he 's right : as Ether gets more expensive , the barrier to entry increases .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Transactions do n't become cheaper in terms of Ether as the conversation rate increases ; those are independent variables .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 So instead , they do like OP , and inject whatever numbers happen to result in " 1 Ether = some big number " .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; If Ethereum acts like a utility , let ’s say like oil , and is ETH is needed for it , wo n’t a higher price make it hard for people to use it ? 

 Yes .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Despite promising massive advances in scaling and affordability , the average cost of a transaction on Ethereum ( in terms of gas usage ! ) has only really gone up over time .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 So yes , a rising price of Ether makes the chain harder to use ; L2 somewhat alleviates this on an individual level , provided the number of transactions an individual makes does not scale faster than the average number of transactions per user that can be settled per on - chain transaction .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 As a blockchain , Ethereum would be better served if it both expected Ether 's price to be very low , and planned to enable that outcome .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Not only would this force a better security posture ( see : all the suggestions about reducing block rewards because the price of Ether has gone up , which are entirely nonsense from a security perspective ) , but it would also force development of a system designed to serve the entire world , not just the small number of people who put in a disproportionate amount of wealth very early on .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`It 's worth keeping in mind that RSA is a [ hedge fund manager](https://www.linkedin.com / in / ryansadams ) who is heavily invested in Ether .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; A higher price in Ether can simply means a lower price of gwei per gas to compensate .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Until shortly before Vitalik 's blockchain resource pricing paper , in which this idea was introduced , Ethereum blocks were rarely full , with only occasional demand spikes linked to ICOs and CryptoKitties .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The fact that people are willing to pay $ 1k for an Ether is said to mean it 's " worth " $ 1k .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The reality , which you may have experienced for yourself if you have used Ethereum , is that in periods of changing demand it is very difficult to estimate the correct gas price to set for transactions .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  If you assume Ethereum will always have large demand for block space ( i.e. you assume block space remains a scarce resource ) , it 's follows that mining a 2x block now actually earns the miner less than if they mine a 1x block now and again in the future .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`If you spend any time in subreddits or discord channels for dapps , you 'll find no end of users complaining about stuck transactions because they did n't understand the game they were inevitably playing by entering Ethereum 's gas market .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 The vast majority of times I see EIP-1559 referenced in this sub , it 's in conjunction with the ( false ) claim that it makes Ethereum " deflationary " and thus " makes the price go up " .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 No , burning fees was part of it from day 1 , and is the actual intent behind it . 

 & gt ; Burning fees to miners reduces total Ethereum supply by less than 0.1 % between now and 2.0 .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; You also assume that miners ' long - term fortunes are tied solely to the Ethereum chain .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`It happening once in the history of Ethereum only makes it a coincidence , not a correlation .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Economic abstraction is generally only seen as a bad thing by people who want Ether to be the " one true currency " , because it removes one of the forcing functions that drives people to buy it .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`In other words , forcing people to use only Ether to pay for gas is a way to artificially drive demand ( and thus , under the logic Eric has used to push issuance reductions , " make the price go up " ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; With ethereum , when the price of ether goes up the price for gas goes down ... 

 This has never been true .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`So what you 're saying is : Ether only sells for a lot of dollars because it 's extremely illiquid .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  For a long time , the only thing that affected the median gas price was the default value in the early wallets ; after that , it only responded to Ethereum Foundation recommendations ( to lower it , generally ) , and even more recently has only really gone up due to demand and inelasticity .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  The Ether cost of gas and the dollar value of Ether are uncorrelated ; the former is driven by demand for block space , and the latter by speculation .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 It 's 100 % false to claim that as the dollar cost of an Ether goes up , the dollar cost of a transaction goes down ( or stays the same ) , because that would imply an inverse correlation between the dollar cost of Ether and the Ether cost of a transaction .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`If people are looking the the dollar cost of transactions , then it means that the ether denomination of gas price goes down when the the dollar denomination of ether goes up .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Otherwise , why is there such a huge difference between Jan 2018 and Dec 2020 when the price was relatively similar ? 

 The point is that gas costs are tied to demand , while Ether price is tied to ... speculation or whatever .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Because of this , it 's true that " if ETH goes up , then the cost to use the network goes up " .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The problem with the whole " ETH is Money " argument in this article is that it pretends the damage to miners ' fee income is somehow less severe than the damage that Ether losing value does .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`If Ether 's price does n't drop on that news then that would just go to show that nobody cared about Ethereum 's technical capabilities anyway , which is good to know earlier rather than later .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Put differently : mining 2x blocks is only " profitable " when compared to the " only mine 1x blocks " strategy on time scales of tens ( maybe hundreds at the upper bound ) of blocks , and in amounts totaling a handful of Ether at best .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Seems to me that this all requires a very particular combination of long - sightedness ( a majority of miners " organically " deciding to forgo immediate profit to push the base fee lower ) and short - sightedness ( not realizing that deliberately crippling the blockchain is going to reduce the value of Ether ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Ether 's price has n't shown itself to respond to throughput in any way , so there should be no expectation that mining bigger or smaller blocks will have any impact on it anyway .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  They have very long - term revenue demands , and as such are interested in maximizing how much they earn in terms of Ether , because they have very little control over or impact on the exchange rate .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  This nets out to supporting strategies that maximize long - term Ether - denominated earnings , without concern about the long - term exchange rate , since that 's largely out of their control or sphere of influence .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; Based on my experience with miners over the years on various blockchains , I tend to believe that short - sightedness will prevail and those " hundredths of an Ether " tips will be enough to cause lots of defections .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; What I do react strongly to is miners thinking that they get to decide what features Ethereum can have purely because they want more money .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Deliberately sabotaging miners ' revenue multiple times in the interests of " pumping the price " is n't " working for Ethereum " , either , and yet you 're backing this push .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 You 're also basing your entire argument on the assumption that the devs are also acting in good faith with regards to switching to PoS.   Given the history so far , I 'm not entirely confident that 's the case , as opposed to them just simply leading people on while extracting value from the chain :)   If that turns out to be true and PoS does n't pan out , Ethereum will be categorically worse off from a security perspective under PoW with all the issuance reductions and EIP-1559 .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; If we were in a thread full of cargo cultists enthusing over how EIP-1559 will make Ethereum " deflationary " and therefore make them all bajillionaires I 'd probably be considered the anti - EIP-1559 wet blanket of the discussion .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; The burning mechanism promoted by EIP-1559 ( the destruction of the basefee ) establishes the dominance of ETH in the Ethereum ecosystem , provides a deflation mechanism for the supply of ETH , and makes tokens scarce and secured in the long run .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`This is still an " economies of scale " problem , in that the larger the absolute quantity of Ether held by a person , the bigger the fraction of it they can afford to stake .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 This is how PoS on Ethereum works , though .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Anyone else who wants to control 10 % of the staking set today must pay literally millions of times more to do so -- and as time goes on , this will eventually become a literally impossible prospect : there simply wo n't be enough Ether for sale to capture an equivalent slice of the staking set , no matter how much capital you have .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 And this is the problem with Ethereum 's specific combination of PoS implementation and monetary policy : whoever bought the most coins the earliest can not be outcompeted , because whatever fraction of the total supply they hold will always set the lower bound on their share of the staking set .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Unless the 320,000 - holder got all that Ether as part of an IPO and they need to sell it for business expenses soon , and the 320 - holder bought the Ether specifically to stake and have no other purpose for holding it .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`People do n't just magically open their wallets to discover they either have 320k Ether or 320 Ether one day .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The Ether that they 've bought for purposes of staking is all that really matters here .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Given how many people hold large amounts of Ether and have been using it to speculate / compound / increase their bags over time , it 's pretty obvious that people do n't just " buy only to stake " .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`You * are the one making different arguments for different actors in this scenario , specifically because you * know * the " if the only difference between them is how much Ether they hold " readily demonstrates that there are indeed economies of scale , even in staking .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 You 're assuming that issuance has any impact on price , which is a pretty shitty assumption with respect to Ethereum , considering you ca n't show any correlation between the two that holds up across the entire lifetime of the chain .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  They want you and everyone else to believe it 's necessary , because they want lower issuance , because they believe it will inflate the value of Ether , making them more wealthy .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  How many iterations has Ethereum 's PoS gone through ?`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 You know next to nothing about Ethereum yet are willing to put all your faith in people you know nothing about , just because you fancy the idea of getting rich off their work ? 

 Not very rational of you :)`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Use the DAO hack as leverage to earn even more Ethereum ( the infamous " I 'm still buying DAO tokens " quote from when DAO tokens were trading at 70%-ish of their redemption value , while having both the inside knowledge and the leverage to ensure that the fork would succeed , allowing him to cash out at 100 % ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Ethereum 's price trajectory has closely mirrored that of Bitcoin , meaning nothing Ethereum itself is doing is really having a measurable impact on the price -- lowering issuance included .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Put differently : if the biggest predictor of the price of Ether is * a different cryptocurrency * , it means the dominant factors affecting the price having nothing to do with the Ethereum itself .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  In all systems that they speculate about here for out - of - band fee payment , it 's never explicitly stated why paying fees in a currency other than Ether is a bad thing .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 In fact , the only thing " wrong " with any of the scenarios presented is that the means of payment is not Ether .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  This means the intent is to reinforce the hegemony of Ether as a currency -- and nothing else .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  In other words : enforcing Ether as having the monopoly on transaction payment .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Hint : " Free from economic privilege , monopolies and artificial scarcities . " 

 And yet enforcing that Ether is the * only * currency with which to pay for transactions is the opposite of the first of those two things : it grants * economic privilege * to people who current hold Ether , and grants a * monopoly * on transaction payment to Ether . 

 And then burning fees adds artificial scarcity to Ether .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Put differently : there 's a much stronger correlation between the price of Ether and the price of Bitcoin than there is between the price of Ether and its current issuance .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Heck , there 's a stronger correlation between the price of Ether and _ literally any other coin _ , which indisputably proves that nothing that is Ethereum - specific is the dominant driver of its price .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`It just means that the miner needs to have Ether on hand to compensate the network for the privilege of using its block space to make money outside the protocol .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  The entire point of making Ether the One True Currency is that economic abstraction is ruled out .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`This is literally what the thing you quoted earlier says : 

 & gt ; This ensures that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum 

 & gt ; Those are side effects , the end goal is to increase the security of the chain .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`And as mentioned , it does n't grant a monopoly on transaction payment , because miners are still free to accept whatever currency they want for transaction payment as long as they pay rent in ether for the block space they 're making money off of .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; Chains other than Ethereum are free to compete with Ethereum , but it 's not fair that Ethereum should give away its block space to miners for free when that block space incurs a cost .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; He does not present himself in any way that would indicate he is here to squeeze more profits ; in fact he seems fairly empathetic with a strong ethos - much like the ETH community as a whole - a sharp contrast to narrative you are creating 

 You seem to think that people are incapable of presenting themselves in such a way as to garner external favor , while secretly acting in ways that enrich themselves at the cost of others .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 There 's no rationale for why this is a good thing , though , except to force Ether to be burnt ( i.e. drive deflationary memes ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`And economic policy can never be governed by fully free market mechanisms , otherwise we would have miners voting to inflate the block reward , extract as much value from Ethereum as possible , then ditch it as a dying network .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; Vitalik has a blog post about why PoS is more decentralized than PoW. It comes down to the fact that anybody can stake in a pool with even a small amount of ether at the same efficiency as a whale , but with PoW , a whale who can afford an ASIC farm earns a much higher percentage return than a hobbyist mining on a GPU with residential electricity .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  For any given user , their fixed costs are approximately the same , regardless of how much Ether they hold -- therefore , by definition , the richer you are , the higher a percentage you can afford to lock up in PoS. 

 Which is , by definition , the rich getting richer at a higher percentage rate .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  It is , by your own definition , making Ethereum less of a free market .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`You have yet to proof this is happening , which is a really fucking tall order , because it implies conspiratory - tier collaboration in a very transparent development and research process , and it does n't at all track with the Ethereum ethos .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  I mean , I could literally go on , Ethereum has a long history of these things happening * all the time*--but people like you just turn a blind eye to it because " when moon " .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; My desire is to see the Ethereum network thrive .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Your desire is for money , and " seeing Ethereum thrive " is the means by which you want to achieve that desire .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; While it 's true that you will need to sign your staking keys ( NOT your Ether itself ) 

 This is actually false .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  You 're essentially advocating for abandoning that principle entirely , and then trying to write it off as a * good thing * . 

 Then again , this is Ethereum we 're talking about , and they abandoned that particular principle with the DAO fork , so yanno , YMMV .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  You do n't get to " spread out across one of the 93,000 32 - eth validators " , you get to spread out across some * very small subset of them * .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`In both cases , devs and Ethereum community would make every effort to respond to this threat , primarily by rushing PoS merge .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 I mean , come on , you ca n't seriously argue that anything happening on Ethereum itself is responsible for its price rise ; otherwise , how would you explain the fact that the one thing it 's most tightly correlated with is the price of Bitcoin ? 

 Saying that " x thing on Ethereum affects the price in y way " would manifest as Ethereum breaking that correlation , which it to date has never done .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  It 's not like miners just accumulate huge piles of Ether and pay their own bills out of pocket or with loans or whatever .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  If the Ethereum community were serious about adoption and the like , they 'd be arguing for * increasing * issuance , not decreasing it .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  A lower price makes it easier for new users to buy in , which increases adoption , since all costs to use the network are purely denominated in Ether .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The fact that they sold some of Ether to users does not mean their proportion of ETH did n't increase relative to user - held ETH . 

 And yet profitable things to mine attract more miners , which reduces the total profit for all miners .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  You wanna get all incredulous , but the reality is that you have no idea what you 're saying at all :P 

 But hey , at least you 've revealed that you 're absolutely fine with the validators getting rich for the sake of getting rich :) 

 & gt ; No ... fuck me , I ca n't believe you 're still going on with the high ETH price = high gas fees .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  I mean , are you really arguing that dollar - denominated fees go * down * when dollar - denominated costs of Ether go up ?`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Here 's where you 're wrong : 

 & gt ; If 0.1 ETH was $ 0.10 and the network was congested , transactions would be 50 ETH instead 

 You realize this conclusion directly contradicts your statement just what ... three sentences prior ?`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Now you 're claiming that if the dollar value of Ether goes down , the ether value of transactions goes up ... which would be that magical linkage you 're claiming does n't exist .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Are they any more bad faith than the EIP-1559 proponents who keep slinging falsehoods like " EIP-1559 will reduce fees " , " EIP-1559 will * increase * miner revenue " , " EIP-1559 will remove the miner incentive to manipulate the fee in order to extract more fees from users " , or " miners want to protect inflated costs to users at the expense of the overall user - experience of Ethereum " ?`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  How about " Flexpool has expressed no concern for the overall health of the Ethereum network and the damage that could be done by solidifying oppressively high fees as part of the network protocol " ?`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; I have some sympathy for them in a way , but also realize they have consciously or unconsciously decided that their interests outweigh those of the entire ETH ecosystem 

 Ironically , you can make this same observation of the Ether whales who have decided that " deflationary monetary policy " is the way to go .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  If your statement " Institutional investors are buying much more ETH than BTC relative to market capitalization " were true , you would expect the ETH / BTC ratio to be rising , not falling / staying flat .`

 & gt ; Increasing ETH price 

 It absolutely is .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  They 're all people who have made it very clear from their other publications and comments that they have a vested interest in seeing the price of Ether go up : their holdings will become more valuable and they 'll become richer .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 What 's that famous quote ? 

 & gt ; Show me the incentives and I 'll show you the outcomes 

 If you start from the " make ETH price go up " incentive , this constant ignoring of the alternative viable mechanisms is the only predicted outcome .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Well , if your goal is to try to " corner the market " on total Ethereum , that approach makes total sense :) 

 Especially if you were one of those buyers during the ICO ...`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`But as a Ether holder who wants the price to go up , you would find some reason to think any competition inferior , would n't you ?`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`I see the evolution of Bitcoin as having followed the same trajectory that Ethereum is currently on , which is why I think the end result will be much the same .`

DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`The lower the liquidity and velocity of Ether goes , the less efficient it becomes as a system , even as it maximizes the margins of those who hold the supply .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 While I agree with both of those statements , I do n't think that precludes the possibility that the thing that Ethereum adds is just a regression to the mean . 

 & gt ; The 2008 financial crisis was the straw that broke the camel 's back ( the last time people would lose money in an investment vehicle they had no control over ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Indeed , but from what I can tell , both Bitcoin and Ethereum have long since regressed to the mean , because again , they 're both selecting for the same profit motives that caused the 2008 crisis .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Hmm , just like how Ethereum bagholders , when left up to them , will keep the supply of Ether constrained .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  It says that the " Ethereum network " [ saves ] up to 90 % of transaction costs " , but that 's considering " burnt " as " saved " , which is uh ... well , that 's one way of looking at it , but not the way most people would look at it .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Also , you 're citing Eric " wants less Ether " Connor , who 's a bagholder , so of course to him the less Ether there is , the more the Ether he has is worth :)`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Miners are structurally long ETH and the Ethereum economy 

 This is why they * wo n't * accept it .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; Your comment history shows quite clearly that you 're a bitcoin maxi and anti - eth .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  After EIP-1559 , you ca n't even do that , meaning you 're wholly dependent upon the underlying efficiency of Ether itself .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  No matter how many people have pooled their Ether into a validator , there 's always only one of each of those keys .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  I believe the three contracts that are actually immutable are the ones that store state ( I believe there are two ? ) and the " vault " , which holds Ether .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`  Given that , I can only assume that all interactions with RocketPool are done through the remainder of their contracts , which are upgradeable -- so things like deposits , withdrawals , exits , etc would be things that could be " intercepted " in the future , by modifying the intermediary code ( i.e. the code that mediates interactions with the immutable contracts , which basically only store state / Ether ) .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`& gt ; The argument is that some entity can just buy up a bunch of ETH to control the network .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Joining a mining pool with a single GPU ( i.e. your typical gaming PC ) is easier than joining a staking pool with 1 Ether .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Ethereum has long since gone from trying to maximize utility to trying to maximize coinholder wealth .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 On the balance , Ethereum has handily proven that having more client implementations has caused more problems than it has prevented .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Let 's see : failed 3 times in its history of what ... 12 years ? 

 Versus Ethereum which has had ... how many consensus failures in its ... what , 6 years ? 

 More than 3 .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum , on the other hand , has had more than 3 in half as many years , only one of which * was n't * a problem arising from having multiple clients .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Between January and March of this year , the exact opposite was true : gas was more expensive * and * Ether was worth more at the end of the range compared to the start .`
DeviateFish_,against,Ethereum,`Except when it is n't , because the value being gained through the transaction is also denominated in Ether .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`no right or wrongs 

 Q : What are your feelings about moving beyond ETH & amp ; BTC ... does every portfolio need some altcoins ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH has huge potential uses , some believe moreso than BTC .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`BTC and ETH are the most established and considered the best starting place for crypto yes :)`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Try to read about bitcoin and ETH if you want to gain a solid foundation as to what most people here are most involved in !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`In simple terms , ETH seems absolutely solid with all the projects it entails , why is the price not higher ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Would this be cheaper than trading for say ETH / GBP or BTC / GBP ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Whilst ETH Takes the spotlight for the day , I think I 'll take the chance to top up on some DeFi !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`not certain , but I think its the ratio of ETH / BTC ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Just got off work to ETH absolutely slaying it 😮 👏 enjoy it team ! !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Remember that day ETH futures got released on CME ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`If ETH is gon na follow in BTC footsteps in the coming days / weeks , I think I better stock up on some while I can !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`If you think ETH is gon na hit 2 K , buying now is effectively a 10 % discount ! [ gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dyor )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Btc & amp ; ETH are considered a great combo for starting out .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Does anyone know of any options on the horizon for staking ETH ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`BTC & amp ; ETH are a great start , but try to read about them and at least understand what they are before diving in ! best of luck :)`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Well , sitting at 2 K ETH and BTC looking like it will touch the atmosphere before coming back to earth !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`BTC will continue to lead the way in the mid term , ETH may have more room for larger % gains .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Remember that for an extra 0.01 ETH per month you can become a premier member too`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`But ETH will cover that if not !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`When ETH passes 2k that 's how you can celebrate !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll be your captain today , please hop abound the ETH fueled hype train ! 

 !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH about to hit £ 1300 hell yeeees`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`A matter of days ago we had people screaming that ETH gas fees had killed it off , never doubt ETH ! !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm excited to see where ETH will be when I wake up ! !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I. E how much ETH went up yesterday 👀 could we ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`If you deposited $ 100 and brought ETH and ETH rose 5 % you 'd now have $ 105 showing as your balance ( sorry if this is obvious - basically it wo nt show your original deposit )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Dollar cost averaging is a brilliant approach , btc and ETH are great long term holds for you starting out 
 My advice would be to dollar cost average into both , then take a few weeks to educate yourself about a couple alts you may want .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH starting to make some sexy moves ! let 's go ! 

 ! [ gif](giphy|rzCb3XwgyZLI58aWFD )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Do you think that ETH 2.0 would be strong enough to allow ETH to rise even if its released during the midst of a bear market ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Yeh , that 's what I 'm saying we could very well be in a bear market when 2.0 launches , but do you think it will be enough to overcome the bearish times and allow ETH to move independently of the market ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH wo nt fly whilst BTC is in price discovery mode , considering that it 's doing a brilliant job !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Some people say ETH does nothing , have you guys looked at the monthly candles on ETH ? !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Yep Feel like we 're not even seeing ETH move on it 's own yet , most of this movement has been btc dragging it up ..`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Market cap of ETH is currently 2X what BTC was 365 days ago , imagine where ETH could go in the next year !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Personally I am heavy on BTC / ETH and alts make up 10 % of   my investment , I find it tiring keeping up with all the alts .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH acting like that super drunk mate that just get 's dragged around the club ( by BTC ) , wait until he has second wind and starts to dance on his own .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Everytime I think about settling down for bed ETH serves up a fat green candle ! [`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH just got dragged up by BTC on that upwards leg to 60k so I 'm not suprised it 's going down with It too ...`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`
 BTC is the safer bet , ETH gives you a potential for higher percentage gains from here , I 'm 50/50 but I do n't think your weighting is bad personally .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`  Do you feel you need more ETH ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH being an independent women , we love to see it ! !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Sat on its ass trying to explain to the Mrs ( ETH ) why it 's acting like a fook`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Sunny 

 Yesterday my heart was filled with rain 

 Sunny , you smile at me and relieve the pain 

 ETH , so true , I love you`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`We 've been shouting that ETH under 2 K is accumulation phase - I 've practiced what I preach and just picked up some more`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Appreciate this one mate , I 've been looking at incorporating ETH in the portfolio for a while .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH you freak what is this ! ! 😍 😍`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Na woke up to watch ETH not gon na lie 😂 👀`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Thag added ETH is mighty good 

 !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`If you see a guy on a tube with the ETH logo above his head like a Sim you know you 've found me 

 !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Keep hodling mate , once ETH runs you know AAVE is gon na be flying`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I hope Ben Cowen is awake , but as he would say 2 K eth is nothing to get out of bed for !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH makes me horny`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I know you highly skilled chart watchers normally operate on 1min candles , but set it to 1 day and look at that all mighty ETH dildo ! !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Now it 's a matter of time until it moves away from ETH I think .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH mining with your GPUs is probably your best bet for now .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Levandoski is BTC , he is out injured so I 'd say this is more bullish for ETH`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Just eat my dinner , missed that little pullback to 2021 for eth , assuming some of you brought that up ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`i see you all waiting for ETH to get to 2 K to buy the shit out of it`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`There 's not really any benefit of buying " a whole ETH " in my opinion .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Unless you 're buying 32 whole ETH to run a node ... 
 You have a few options 
 Wait , potentially it does n't go down to that then you FOMO in 
 Or you dollar cost average 
 Or you just buy now 

 Depends on your appetite for risk , patience etc .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's not a bad idea , but there is no benefit of having 1 ETH over having 0.96 or 1.12 , like it 's just a number .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Human physcology for some reason makes us think we need a whole ETH or btc etc ...`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,` 
 For example , for ETH this page shows them .... not sure what coin you 're after but hope the example helps . 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 [ https://www.bitmex.com/app/trade/ETHUSD](https://www.bitmex.com/app/trade/ETHUSD )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Also , ETH went flying to a new ATH but I 'm sure you know that ! 

 Other than that , things have been fairly quiet .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd agree it is down to the individual ye , I am not saying either is the correct answer 

 I 'd consider myself low - med risk , yet holding ETH over the past week has made ~40 % gain , that is pretty mad .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`To consolidate without even really a 10 % dip is pretty bullish and makes me feel there is plenty of momentum left in the bullrun ... 
 For ETH ( my main hold )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`After that it could be a ripper for ETH if we sustain momentum from eip1559 , to Eth2.0 and the cliffening ... 
 But on the other hand , it could all end tomorrow haha crypto is a mysterious beast`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm an open member of the ETH clan , but I 'm always keen to be exposed to opposing views etc to learn , my question .. 

 Does BNB have upcoming updates / plans in the same way that ETH does ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Remember what happened 7 days ago ? 

 The holy good Friday where ETH soared past 2k to an ATH , beautiful`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`My outlook is that it needs to be a number you can still stay on top of in terms of updates / news etc . 

 I hold 5 ( including BTC , ETH & amp ; mighty moons ) , sometimes even that feels overwhelming .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Am I right in thinking the Berlin hard fork will optimize something behind how gas fees are decided , but probably wo n't directly reduce gas fees for normal users ? 

 Either way , another step on the road to ETH serenity

DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`It could be the same force that 's responsible for dark matter , which shaped the early universe "  


 I think they detected some ETH particles by accident`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`rocketpool will release very soon and should be a better way to stake eth without locking it up until eth2`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH and AAVE flying together , my day has come

DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,` 
 Optimizing how ETH fees are distributed / decided basically .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Pfft that ETH sell wall at 2500 , who are these lunatics selling`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Let ETH soar into flight mode .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`some would say we 're irresponsibly long on eth , but hey![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|this_is_gentlemen )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I thought people would take profits on Doge to buy BTC / ETH .... is the opposite happening ? !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Some weird shit going on in the markets today , eth wicked to 2300 out of nowhere there`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`As ever , most bullish on ETH .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`
 It makes me a little uneasy tbh , but seeing ETH performing so strong gives me hope .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`This is the fee that is currently paid to miners ( as ETH ) , therefore this by burning the fee , you 're burning eth .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Recall that there is also ETH being mined ( i.e new ETH coming into circulation ) .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`
 If your question in its simple terms are do I think ETH price has room to grow .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Love to hear that , hope you 're resting easy now ! 
 Yes I got more btc ETH and AAVE , so I 'm happy/`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Btc and eth 
 Bitcoin will continue to see the share of new money , for now 
 When ETH fulfills its potential it should grow very well`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Btc and eth are great places to start , but have a read about them and see what you think first`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Why am I such a hoe for ETH , I see it creep towards 2 K and I ca n't resist`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Just send me that leftover 0.8 ETH , it will save you spending money ! [ gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dyor )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`That 's how owning ETH feels right now , so much utility and scalability possible ... !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Staggering ETH at 2240 is now considered a dip , we 've come a long way in a year ..`

DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH heard that we got done over with half moons , so thought it would give us a show !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Just stopping in on my tea break to say that ETH is a beast .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`
 The though of getting a whole ETH with moons tempts me`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I just read that ETH is the only one`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`if btc drops another 10 % ( i.e tests 20 week SMA ) then we will see ETH sub 2k , would likely be a lot of buyers at that point`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH offers a totally different investment , you 're investing into an infrastructure which is scalable and offers utility .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Great that ETH is up , not sure we 're out of the woods yet .`

DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n't help but think what a $ 2700 ETH would feel like ....`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH at 2600 a dip , fuck me I like the sound of that haha`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is pretty much open source , people just pick up the blue print and try to do it better .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I can offer you a loan of ETH , we just need your kidney as collateral`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's coming , aave will ride the eth tsunami !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`When ETH goes to PoS and we have a huge % of ETH locked up with staking plus defi ....`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`This eth therefore is n't liquidity that will be traded , it 's basically locked away .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Yeh you get interest , variable Apr depending on how much eth is staked in the pool etc`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's not priced in though , else eth would be way past 3k , nearing 5`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Everyone is assuming EIP1559 makes eth deflationary , it does n't , it gives it the architecture possible to be so .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I know we all want ETH to fly , but it 's worth noting that we need BTC to continue its rise until at least PoS is released to see the true coming of age of ETH in terms of price ...`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Think you 're misunderstanding what 's coming for ETH .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,` 


 Also , although the theoretical supply is infinite , EIP1559 will mean ETH now burns 70 % of gas fees , so if this outweighs the rate at which ETH is mined , it will become deflationary  


 Then you can add in the ETH that is locked up in DeFi and staking ( will go up loads with PoS )`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine this , It 's early 2022 ... 

 & amp;#x200B ; 

 ETH has just got home from work as a store of value , now starting its nightshift as a computer upon which to host the digital economy .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Furthermore , EIP1559 means now even though fees are low , there are so many transactions that the burning rate has made ETH deflationary ....  


 Do you see where I 'm going with this ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`

 Saw ETH has done 15 green weekly candles out of the last 20 ....`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Couple months ago people were saying eth was dead ... 

 !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH making me as erect as those weekly candles`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Pretty sure the British national grid is going to collapse when ETH hits £ 2000 and we all boil the kettle for a celebratory cup of tea ! ! !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I know we 're all hyped on ETH right now , but seems a good time to continuously accumulate before the next big leg up`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Where do you think ETH is heading on the ETH / BTC ratio ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`hhahah if only I could spunk 100k , you know I 'd be an ETH 32 node runner`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH wicked down to $ 2050 last week , now we 're sitting pretty at basically $ 2800 ....`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I believe I need to :  
 \- Set up metamask , send eth from wallet to metamask 

 \- connect metamask to uniswap , trade eth / coin\_I\_want 

 \-send coin\_I\_want from metamask to wallet ? 

 Is that correct ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Eip1559 means eth Jay actually become deflationary if burning gas fees exceeds mining rate`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`You can run your own node , you get rpl as well as eth , quite a few imo`

DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Waking up to $ 3000 ETH is surreal , congratulations everyone !`

 BTC and ETH are brilliant places to start in terms of understanding the space as they have proven they can stand the test of time .`

DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,` 
 Also , it will mean 70 % of gas fees are burned , so ETH could become deflationary if burning exceeds mining rate .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`However , I think I need to convert eth to rETH to stake ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Ratio vs eth is so low , so many will need to buy it to run a node ...`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`I was talking about etc flipping eth .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Do you think ETH will break 2500 wall for good this time ?`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`na , I already have a strong stack of ETH , I like to keep moons as my alternative than holding some random alt .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is taking me places I 've never been before !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Strong buy support on ETH at 3400 .. let 's see what happens !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`

 45 % from here , without feeling the effects of EIP1559 or PoS yet ... come on ! 

 The amount of ETH locked in staking & amp ; DeFi will more than double in less than 12 months , reduced liquidity and likely increased demand to use the network with lower fees , should drive increased price`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`It 's a solid defi project , you 'll see large growth once defi is accessible with more L2s and low eth fees`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Big step for ETH , likely will close way up on the eth btc ratio again this week now , its all fun from here on in ! !`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Met a friend for a couple of hours and eth rose by $ 200 , I could get used to this`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is literally sucking money from everywhere .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`How you feel when you look at a list of shitcoins then realise eth is the one`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`Staggering how far ETH has come since the turn of the year .`
DeeDot11,favor,Ethereum,`OK then team , where would you say ETH is right now ? !`

 Only invest what you can afford to lose

SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;what do you guys think is it likely to happen ? 

 Ethereum will flip BTC within the next 5 - 10 years .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`You do n't need to do anything with your ETH * unless * you plan on staking it . 

 And yes , you could stake it right now , as today the PoS blockchain launched .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Plus Bitcoin does n't have the capability for complex smart contracts like Ethereum has .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The fact that Ethereum , the most thriving ecosystem , gets censored is abysmal , that 's why I voted for it .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`A reason not to stake would be that your staked ETH will be locked until Phase 1.5 of ETH2 , which could take 2 years or so .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`90 % of stablecoin action happens on ETH and I do n't see that changing anytime soon .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The reality is that most stablecoin volume and issuance sits on Ethereum , and for good reason .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum already exists for years , has the track record , security , features , dev tooling , network effects , etc .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Lightning has 0 traction , Liquid has 0 traction , I expect Taproot and Schorr signatures to get 0 traction as well . 

 Ethereum is light years ahead .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Please elaborate how Ethereum does n't serve its purpose as a smart contract platform .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 You are deeply delusional if you think that DeFi devs and users will just like that abandon Ethereum for some other chain .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`If you think Ethereum 's development is slow , I wish you a lot of patience if everything that 's built on Cardano needs to be peer reviewed ( and that 's ridiculous and wo n't even happen ) .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I read things like " Ethereum fails miserably at being a smart contract platform " which is so obviously not true at all .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`If this works which I strongly believe it will , gas fees will be a thing of the past and fast transactions are finally the standard on Ethereum .`

 Head of the OCC ( Office of the Comptroller of Currency ) tweeting about Decentralized Finance ( which happens to 99 % on Ethereum ): https://twitter.com/BrianBrooksOCC/status/1349006667602677761 

 Just recently , the OCC released an interpretive letter that allows banks to run blockchain nodes and to use public blockchains as settlement instruments ( similar to SWIFT ): https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/90025/occ-regulator-banks-stablecoins-issuance 

 This opens the door far and wide for Ethereum , because the biggest stablecoin volume happens on Ethereum .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is working on ETH2.0 which introduces sharding ; meanwhile rollups like Loopring or zkSync are already live , which is all you need for cheap transactions that * still * inherit all the security of Layer 1 . 

 This is a non - issue .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`( imagine there was an inflationary bug that gave people hundreds of ETH , and they all withdraw to the old chain and sell ) 

 The beacon chain is supposed to run for a year or so and be battle tested before the shards become activated .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`You left out the rest of the quote : 

 & gt;Ether could get off the hook , Mr. Gensler said , because its development has been more decentralized recently , and new Ether tokens are now given out to so - called miners through a network .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is behind the curve in getting adopted ?`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I know exactly what people are doing on Ethereum : DeFi .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;Despite several other dApp / Web protocols having ETH beat

 People with a smaller stack are currently priced out , so when Layer 2 comes online over the next months , we will see a spike in activity . 

 And I see you tossed some Ethereum Foundation FUD in as well .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm glad you sold all your ETH .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 I 'm curious as to why you criticize Ethereum so much when you invest in projects that are , let 's say , debatable .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has crossed the point of being a speculative asset only .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The difference is that Ethereum is one of the few cryptos that has real world usage and is primed for more .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 But I do want to see Ethereum succeed aside from the monetary aspects .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I wish I had thousands of ETH , it would make the flippening that much sweeter .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`When I compare the state of Ethereum to 3 years ago , I see incredible advancements .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`People will realize that Ethereum is a credibly neutral global settlement layer .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 You can earn yield on your ETH by staking , something Bitcoin ca n't unless you 're using centralized custodians like BlockFi .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There are n't many people shittalking ETH on r / bitcoin because the powerhungry mods ban you for even mentioning it .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Given that ETH is nowhere near parabolic yet , it 's a non - issue .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There 's not a single " ETH killer " that is 10x better , so they do n't matter much .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`When the decision to halt and reverse the DAO was made , eth screamed to the world " your smart contract will be censored if we do n't like what it does " .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 In other words , Ethereum is lightyears ahead of any competition and shows no signs of slowing down .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`It 's just disingenous to say Ethereum does n't have a clear advantage right now .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't demand that they allow shitcoin shilling , but Ethereum is as established as can be , the # 2 crypto .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 In the same vein , the community agrees that sharding under ETH 2.0 is the goal .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 You are aware that Ethereum is a smart contract platform , right ?`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`You 're also aware that Ethereum 's community has different goals compared to Bitcoin 's community , right ? 

 Like I said , the people hold the power .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum 's community does n't want it to stop evolving .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`In fact , Ethereum 's community would consider Ethereum a failed project if it did stop to evolve .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`You 're clearly heavily biased against Ethereum so I do n't think this discussion has any merits .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The paper said you can take a bet on it , and that there 's good reason to believe Ethereum will succeed .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;The purpose behind the call between the Mayor and the Cryptex Finance team was to discuss the possibilities of using Ethereum to promote the city ’s cryptocurrency strategy .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I wonder what they 're planning to build directly on Ethereum , then .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`He 's not talking about Optimism , he 's talking about Optimistic Ethereum , often referred to as Optimism .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum has a programming language called Solidity that enables complex smart contracts to be coded that are executed by the EVM .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`So yes , it 's not entirely accurate to say it 's being built on Ethereum , but it 's built with Solidity and executed by the Ethereum network .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 The benefit of doing it on Ethereum is clear as day - no central party will have control over your funds or can censor what you 're doing .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Synthetix is Ethereum based , Mirror is based on some small blockchain I 've never heard of , but the token also exists on Ethereum`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`It 's basically ETH except that it 's DPoS , has no dapps , little dev share , and still has to deliver smart contracts without an additional delay .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`He 's talking about the benefits of Ethereum while implying that it 's Bitcoin that does all these things .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;Let ’s also not forget that a large portion of Ethereum transactions actually never hit the mempool but are shared with miners off - chain 

 EIP-1559 would help eliminate this specific attack vector .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The DAO hack ( I assume that 's what you 're talking about ) was very , very early in Ethereum 's history .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll not get too deep into this but essentially , the Ethereum community would * not * let this happen again .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Some people would go as far to say that Ethereum is un - forkable because of the sheer amount of smart contracts that have dependencies on Oracles .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`He hates Ethereum so he 's trying to spin it like Bitcoin can do DeFi .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Everybody knows gas fees are an issue , that 's why there are countless Layer 2 solutions built and ETH 2 on the horizon .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 I 've heard countless people on Twitter during the DeFi craze last summer say how the value wo n't accrue to ETH , how it 's just the projects that go up , etc etc . 

 Now look at the price of ETH and compare it to last summer .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I doubt the APR drops below 4 % ever because at that point , using ETH as collateral in DeFi becomes a viable alternative to get higher rates .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There 's a difference in fee between moving ETH and using smart contracts .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Even if ETH had 25 times the TPS it currently has , demand would bring fees right back to where they were .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Cardano 's base layer would suffer from the same fee problem as Ethereum , Layer 2 is the only solution long - term .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Hydra is years away from implementation , rollups are live today on Ethereum .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Layer 2 is inevitable and already live on Ethereum and will only improve from here .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`However , people that believe ADA will flip Ethereum in a couple months are wildly delusional .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum made them a reality .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 People are * so * quick to shit on Ethereum simply because of the fees .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`You do n't realize that the only reason this exists is because Ethereum is credibly neutral and decentralized , and no other platform comes even close to that status .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Because he only cares about pumping ADA and dethroning Ethereum .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 This allows you to go from fiat to ETH / token directly on Layer 2 without ever touching Layer 1 .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There are research efforts underway for a stateless Ethereum which would allow us to significantly increase the gas limit .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 This is n't Ethereum grasping to it for dear life , this is Ethereum getting ready for mass adoption .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`so you 're admitting that you 're at war with the entire Ethereum community and have no interest at all in what 's best for the protocol ?`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;you have been tribalized and think anybody against 1559 is against eth .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`And that 's what Ethereum is going for .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Just to give you a hint of how powerful and popular Ethereum is .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum is a fucking Kraken ; a black hole with an incredible network effect that sucks in everything into its grasp .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There are lots of people subtly pushing the narrative that Ethereum is just as ossified as Bitcoin and not doing anything to solve these issues , and they could n't be more wrong .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The reason it takes so long to implement solutions is because 

 1 ) Ethereum has a world - class team of researchers that come up with incredible breakthroughs all the time : https://github.com/Awesome-Layer-2/awesome-layer-2 

 Virtually all L2 research has been made by Ethereum researchers , competitors have n't even given L2 a thought yet , because .. 

 2 ) Ethereum aims to remain decentralized without compromises .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is sporting 100,000 individual validators for the beacon chain right now , others do n't come close .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 You simply can not expect Ethereum 's entire ecosystem to migrate right now .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`And you complain about Ethereum being slow in terms of development ?`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Cardano has DPOS at the protocol level , Ethereum only makes DPOS possible at the application level .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`This makes Ethereum 's POS far more secure and decentralized .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum does n't allow staking pools to form at this layer , it 's pure POS .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`A quick ELI5 and history of scaling solutions for Ethereum and why this is a HUGE development .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Uniswap has already announced they will migrate there , and if Uniswap moves there , a significant part of Ethereum 's ecosystem will move there .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 This effectively eliminates the high gas fee issue for Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`And state channels on Ethereum are n't much better , this is n't even about Bitcoin vs Ethereum , it 's just state channels vs rollups , and rollups prove to be an excellent solution .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`So you can go from fiat - & gt ; ETH / token straight to Optimism without ever touching Layer 1 :)`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`if it 's less than 32 ETH you could look into staking it with an exchange , Kraken already does that , Coinbase will follow soon .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Essentially it works exactly the same way Ethereum currently works , users simply have to transfer their funds to the rollup one single time and you 'll enjoy high TPS and super low fees for all dapps on the rollup .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`No , I think most rollups will use ETH as gas .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`4- Staking ETH is about to get much easier due to Rocketpool launching soon ( which is completely decentralized ) , and the merge of the PoW chain to PoS is happening Q1 2022 , so the lockup is until then at most .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`This can be abstracted away on Ethereum as well , especially with all the scalability Layer 2 and sharding will bring .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`there 's no need to wrap any tokens , they should work on Optimism just like they do on Ethereum today .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`It took DeFi to explode to make people realize Ethereum is here to stay .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;The fact is that ETH is practically unusable right now .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Funny that you mention DYDX , because they are currently implementing on a rollup to fix the fees : https://twitter.com/dydxprotocol/status/1367130553791700996 

 & gt;What 's disturbing is that the ETH community on CC is becoming more dishonest and more like a cult .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`What I have seen are people explaining the nuances , like how a simple ETH transfer does n't cost more than $ 5 or so .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;Btw I 'm not selling because I think ETH can fix its problems .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There have been a couple threads about how Ethereum is addressing these issues , such as the Optimistic rollup launch in March , stateless Ethereum , and other rollups such as zk - rollups , and EIP-1559 .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Optimism for example will still require you to use ETH as gas , but others may enable you to pay in whatever token you have at hand .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I do n't see a future where LN gets any adoption at all , given the fact you can do all of this on Ethereum and it 's much better due to the wide userbase , liquidity , devs & amp ; dev tooling etc .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Rollups are a much better solution and I have n't heard anything from Cardano on that front , but Ethereum has zk rollups live with $ 100 m in liquidity on Loopring and optimistic rollups launch on March 15th and they can support all dapps on Ethereum .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`In that case I think it 'd be even worse because in Ethereum at least you can get your transaction confirmed if you pay enough .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`meaning it gives you the full security of Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`By not having to sell their ETH to get cash on their hands they can maintain their exposure to the price of ETH and simultaneously avoid incurring a taxable event .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There 's billions of dollars in smart contracts on Ethereum by now , including the deposit contract for ETH2 .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Companies just need to realize that , especially with EIP-1559 , Ethereum will have a crazy good cash flow comparable to dividend - yielding stocks .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 This has the added benefit of potentially making ETH deflationary , but it 's not the goal of the EIP .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`You 're fudding Ethereum like mad in this thread , there 's not even a hint of you trying to argue in good faith anywhere .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 The issue I have is n't that miners are making too much profit , the issue I have is that nobody can put forward a credible argument as to why Ethereum would suddenly be in jeopardy after EIP-1559 when we have seen similar drops in hashrate dozens of times before .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;Developers are betting that this burning of fees , the subsequently lower monetary inflation rate will cause the ETH prices to increase making up for any loss of revenues for miners .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Mintable.app allows you to mint NFTs for free on Ethereum .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`With the rise of DeFi and NFTs I can clearly see that Ethereum wo n't see another 90 % drawdown but you may disagree .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`In the end , we do n't invest in Ethereum because of the 4 year hype cycle , but because we know it has the potential to change the world .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 As for the effect of 1559 on the price of ETH , it is projected to bring inflation down to a pretty small level and/or potentially make it deflationary depending on the amount of fees generated , so based on supply / demand if there is less supply but steady demand price should go up .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`But the coverage by the mainstream media had headlines like " Visa to settle USDC with Bitcoin partners " which is n't technically wrong but completely fails to mention the biggest news , which is Ethereum being used by Visa .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum is so far ahead there 's really no hope for Bitcoin smart contracts .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The ETH locked in DeFi is n't really " locked " but it 's generating yield so it 's unlikely to be sold , in fact it 's more likely that more will be locked up because of the attractive yields as OP pointed out .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I 'd recommend to stay on Ethereum , so Sushiswap or if you want lower fees try Loopring or Quickswap on Polygon .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin maxis are scared that ETH will dethrone BTC .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`No , the future are decentralized rollups on ETH , not some copy pasted EVM chain with 20 validators .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The public cares about what it can use , and Ethereum is opening up a world of possibilities with smart contracts , DeFi and NFTs .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 And like I said , ETH is as well distributed as BTC because of the years of PoW mining , it makes no difference at all .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`This is impossible under POS as bad actors get slashed and China would have to buy so much ETH on the open market that it 'd drive prices beyond anything affordable .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`When DeFi settles more value than Bitcoin , NFTs link meme and gaming culture to Ethereum , do you think people will believe in the asset&amp;platform that they use on a daily basis ( ETH ) or in an asset that has no backing through utility and is entirely based on pure belief ?`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I 've seen a lot of people confused about upcoming Ethereum updates such as EIP-1559 and the merge to Proof of Stake .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`This article is very noob - friendly with tons of graphics illustrating what 's going to happen to Ethereum ( and its supply ) over the coming months and years : https://coinstack.substack.com/p/ethereum-will-beat-bitcoin-by-2025`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you 're paying attention , you can see where ETH is headed .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`I think Balancer just took issue with the way it was reported , as some   groundbreaking new development that would render Ethereum useless .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 I would add that the one thing that sets Ethereum apart from competing platforms is that Ethereum is the only platform that takes the blockchain trilemma seriously .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum wants that everyone can run a node .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`But we all know you hate Ethereum .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`They 're fast as well . 

 And then there 's Ethereum that despite all the competition shows no signs of slowing down with all the protocol upgrades coming this year .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`He 's downplaying all the years of effort that went into building it from the ground up on Ethereum .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 It 's clear as day that removing really good , discussion - spurring posts just because there 's already a news article that mentions " Ethereum " in its headline is already on the front page is just plain dumb & amp ; bad for the overall subreddit .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`And Ethereum does n't have P&amp;D groups , it 's way too big for that kinda stuff anyway .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum ( ETH ): 90 % of innovation in crypto happens on it with the biggest dev & amp ; user community yet people completely sleep on it`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 You can certainly benefit from BNB in the short term , but I would n't feel comfortable holding it knowing that Ethereum is about to release some of the most revolutionary protocol upgrades in all of crypto .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`In case this is n't common knowledge , here 's how that compares to how much ETH will be burned after EIP-1559 goes live in July : https://twitter.com/FroggyFrogster/status/1383001073162551297`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`because miners knew from day 1 that Proof of Stake is coming so they were able to accumulate ETH for staking .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 the next updates are rollups on top of Ethereum that give us massive scalability , EIP-1559 in July to make gas fees predictable and put a stop to the inflation , and the full merge to Proof of Stake by the end of this year to get rid of Proof of Work . 

 Beyond that there are more upgrades but it 'd take me too long to get into all of that .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 People do n't like to hear this but all of the innovation happened and happens on Ethereum , that 's why there have been dozens of ETH killers so far and all of them failed .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`This is an Ethereum sub and yet people do n't get banned for talking about Bitcoin or other coins .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum just had the Berlin hardfork , London is coming July 14th and the merge is scheduled for October .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The Ethereum Foundation has no say over Ethereum 's monetary policy , any changes are communicated to the community to build consensus , core devs discuss , and if after all of that people disagree , they can simply reject any and all changes by opting to not adopt them in their nodes / miners .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Yes , truly incredibly tainted that you were able to buy 2000 ETH for 1 BTC during the public sale .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ask any Ethereum dapp developer and they 'll laugh at you for suggesting that .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`In this sense it 's basically equal to bridging over your stuff to a different L1 , except that you have the full safety of Ethereum on your side .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`What if I told you that the ETH pump is entirely reasonable because it 's based on rock solid fundamentals ? 

 A productive asset that can be transformed into a multitude of different asset classes should be at the top , not a pet rock .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Given the fact that there are already more than $ 10b in ETH staked , it would 

 1 ) drive ETH prices to the stratosphere if any big player has to accumulate several billions of $ of ETH 

 2 ) only 900 validators can be activated per day 

 3 ) if you attack the network you get slashed and lose your ETH 

 It annoys me to no end that people act like PoS is easily corruptible , it is absolutely not .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`the number under Ethereum 's Proof of Stake is n't 51 % , it 's closer to 67 % .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you think you can acquire 67 % of all staked coins in any meaningful timeframe while not driving the price of ETH through the stratosphere , good luck .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;who / what process decides which validators are activated ? 

 Ethereum core devs are responsible for the implementation of the beacon chain which has been under development for several years and launched last december .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum 's governance is open for everyone to participate so anyone can make their proposals heard and get them discussed .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Do n't believe everything bitcoin maxis tell you , they have a vested interest to make Ethereum and PoS look as bad as possible .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;If you use fiat money for a PoS system , you are basing the system on the whims of the central banks - the value layer is shakey / speculative / flawed at best 

 But we do not do that - Ethereum had a bootstrapping period of PoW for a reason , and even if there was n't , Ethereum now creates so much economic value of its own that it 's entirely sustaining itself as value - tons of things in DeFi are paired against ETH as unit of account , NFTs as well . 

 & gt;As a huge fan of Ethereum from day one , I still believe gas should be denominated in sats , not wei .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Bitcoin could have been Ethereum , but the community rejected Vitalik 's proposals , so he made his own thing .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Today , the coins are so well distributed that the supply of ETH is as well distributed as Bitcoin 's .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`And let 's not forget that Satoshi mined 5 % of the BTC supply ( that 's an order of magnitude more BTC than Vitalik owns ETH ) .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`If you have any questions , feel free to come by the daily discussion thread on r / ethfinance , say that you 're kinda new and people will gladly explain any aspect of Ethereum or PoS that you have questions about .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Maybe you need to give it another read ? 

 & gt;If you have billions ( like the founders of Ethereum do with their printed Ether ) , you can collectively launch an attack on Eth2 . 

 Vitalik has $ 1b worth , that 's around 0.3 % of the supply .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Given the fact that only 900 validators can be activated per day ( that 's ~$3.15 m worth of ETH ) , it 'd take years to acquire a majority of the staked ETH , and in that time the staked ETH will rise as more and more people stake .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum would never have gotten off the ground without PoW. Do you think mining ETH was a pointless task ?`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The Ethereum founders chose to print their own Ether out of thin air to line their pockets fund the project .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 The way you talk about Ethereum makes me think you 're really not all that much of a fan at all .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Vitalik realized this , and he also got insane pushback from the Bitcoin community - why build on Bitcoin if the ethos of Bitcoin and what Vitalik had in mind are n't compatible ? 

 & gt;If you are against Proof of Work , then you are against Ethereum , who 's economic foundation is built on it .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The truth is , as revolutionary as the EVM was , it could have existed as a Proof of Stake system from day one using Bitcoin as the base currency , and saved a crapload of " wasted Proof of Work " mining ETH .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`The reason Ether exists is so the founders could get a larger stack on launch day .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`If you are willing to ascribe Satoshi holyness and innocence in mining 5 % of the supply , then you can ascribe Vitalik holyness and innocence in premining some ETH to bootstrap development and pay people .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`If Ethereum had n't done this , it 'd have taken a much longer time to get things going . 

 & gt;That 's easy : it 's centralized .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`Funny thing is that Ethereum is going to be deflationary by the end of this year / early next year , and ETH sees actual real demand because it 's used as trustless collateral in DeFi , as gas for all sorts of smart contract transactions , and as a medium of exchange for NFTs ( most of them are priced in ETH ) .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 I am fully convinced Ethereum will flip Bitcoin fairly soon , maximum 5 years from now .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;It seems you are saying is that Proof of Work is acceptable / forgivable for Ethereum , but not for any other project - you ca n't have it both ways 

 No , I 'm saying it 's ok to use it as a bootstrapping method but at some point switching to PoS is mandatory to not harm the environment as it achieves the same security guarantees .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`

 Other than that , I mostly agree with your common ground these s , but I think the crypto space vastly underestimates the capabilities of Ethereum core devs .`
SwagtimusPrime,favor,Ethereum,`There are like 10 central banks around the world trialing a CBDC on Ethereum ( permissioned or public network ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;it is massively less energy hungry than bitcoin which is the subject here 

 That is why we have Ethereum , which is moving to full POS .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Then , a few weeks from now , you can transfer your ETH to the deposit contract , start staking , and get an even higher return .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Anyway , I suggest you skip BTC and go straight to ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Yet the immediate need for the merge is pressing because more people will be willing to deposit ETH for staking if the lockup period can be shortened .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The devs and the Foundation need to emphasize that the merge will be re - prioritized over sharding to shorten the ETH lockup period .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Just say : both Bitcoin and Ethereum are important and you should be paying attention .`

Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`"   EIP 1559 is a specific proposal expected in 2021 that will make three fundamental improvements to Ethereum : 

 1 ) Improve user experience with wallets 

 2 ) Burn a portion of the transaction fees , thereby reducing ETH issuance ( i.e. , making ETH more scarce ) 

 3 ) Reduce transaction spam 

 This particular EIP does n't increase transactions / sec .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Respect for taking time to answer questions of the newcomers to the Ethereum ecosystem .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin smart contracts are like working through a straw , whereas Ethereum smart contracts are like working through a high bandwidth connection .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The richness of Ethereum smart contract abilities are unmatched by Bitcoin , and never can be matched by Bitcoin due to fundamental architectural differences .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The main benefit is that Ethereum will be the most decentralized blockchain in the world after POS is fully implemented .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Staking means that you are helping to secure the network , and you earn about 10 % per year of new ETH for doing that .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`With ETH2 on the horizon , there is nothing Polk can do that Ethereum wo n't be able to do .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  And it can be all of these at once -- the wonderful world of Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;The vast majority of times I see EIP-1559 referenced in this sub , it 's in conjunction with the ( false ) claim that it makes Ethereum " deflationary " and thus " makes the price go up " .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  " Price go up " is the built - in self - perpetuating mechanism for attracting interest to Ethereum , thereby expanding its reach .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The first thing I hear from newcomers to the space is that they wo n't touch Ethereum because someone told them there is an infinite supply .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  That someone , of course , is one of hundreds of thousands of people trying to stop Ethereum from succeeding .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The # 1 attack used against Ethereum is that it has no finite supply .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`EIP 1559 vanquishes that piece of FUD , the absence of which will allow Ethereum to expand and to flourish .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Serenity / full POS will make Ethereum the most decentralized blockchain in the world .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The social contract of Ethereum is not " let 's keep the status quo " all the time .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`" Wondering if having around 30 % ETH would make my wallet less volatile .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 Eth miners want Ethereum to succeed , because they are large holders of ETH . 

 & gt;Users could of course counter this move with their own attempt to UASF away the fees , but this would take time to coordinate even if it succeeded .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 It would n't take that long to coordinate , and it would 100 % succeed because the entire Ethereum community ( minus a few miners ) are united on seeing EIP 1559 through .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;who are about to get kicked off Ethereum anyhow because of the PoS transition and arguably now have a financial interest in Ethereum failing .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`The developer teams of both Ethereum and Polkadot have been very politically correct over the years saying that they are not competitors .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  But would you agree that with Turing - complete rollup tech that inherits the security guarantees of the base Ethereum chain , anything that you can do on a different chain can be done on Ethereum at near - zero cost , and with better decentralization / security .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  But the thrust of network effects is with Ethereum , along with the sheer size of the current stake , which will ultimately result in the most secure / decentralized blockchain in the world .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I think in the not - too - distant future , if you are not building on L2 rollup tech on Ethereum , you are missing something .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`One of the goals is to remove the primary FUD used against Ethereum : that the supply of ETH is " infinite .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The newcomers to the space are immediately taught to avoid Ethereum because of its inflationary monetary policy .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I suggest that the mining community drop its opposition to EIP 1559 , because we are about to enter the summer of Ethereum , and miners will be some of the primary beneficiaries .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I suggest you stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum 50/50 .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  ETH is still somewhat speculative given that ETH2 has n't been completed rolled out yet , but that also means that it has more upside than BTC .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Another important benefit is that it steals away the primary FUD used by BTC maximilists and other ETH - haters that Ethereum 's money supply is " infinite . "   Finally , it reduces incentives for mining pools to spam the network .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Given that EIP 1559 steals away the primary FUD promulgated by BTC maximalists and other ETH - haters ( that the supply of Ethereum is " infinite " ) , this EIP will permit Ethereum to flourish , thereby increasing the reward per block for miners ( just as the blocking of ProgPow was ultimately beneficial for miners ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  In addition , this EIP significantly improves the wallet user experience , reduces network spam , and accelerates the entire Ethereum ecosystem to the next level .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  It is all of the newcomers to the space that immediately get taught by the BTC maximalists and other " ETH Killer " projects that the monetary policy of Ethereum is overly - inflationary .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I suggest that the vocal minority within the mining community ( and you ) drop your opposition to an EIP that is going to significantly advance the Ethereum ecosystem .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Simple answer is : anyone can stake ETH , whereas only persons / companies with specialized skill and equipment can mine a POW chain .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I do n't understand this cartel given that EIP 1559 will ultimately be beneficial for miners , along with the rest of the Ethereum community .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt;I remember Ethereum people also thinking that no one will keep mining the old chain after the DAO and that the chain would never finalize because of difficulty .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 That would be their way of stating that they want to see the Ethereum network fail and go down in value .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The benefits are so acute with EIP 1559 , that it will drive Ethereum to the next levels .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 But in the outside chance that you think miners can protest and prevent the chain from processing transactions , then that will be the end of miners on Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Flexpool is anti - progress of the Ethereum network , unfortunately , so you get my downvote .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I would recommend that you instead buy ETH and stake it .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Sad to watch , especially when actual decentralized cryptos like BTC and ETH are going about changing the world .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,` 

 EIP 1559 , on the other hand , does other things such as vastly improve the wallet user experience , reduces network spam , and improves the monetary policy of Ethereum ( will make ETH more scarce ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  That said , Ethereum really is n't considered the next bitcoin .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Ethereum will swallow up everything else ( this is actually already happening ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  BTC and ETH is where you eventually end up .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  BTC and ETH are where you eventually end up .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  You skipped the gateway drugs ( Doge and XRP ) and jumped straight to where people go in the end ( BTC and ETH ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  You skipped the gateway drugs ( Doge and XRP ) and jumped straight to where people go in the end ( BTC and ETH ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  You skipped the gateway drugs ( Doge and XRP ) and jumped straight to where people go in the end ( BTC and ETH ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I suggest you focus on the two most promising projects : BTC ( for digital gold / store of value ) , and ETH ( for everything else ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  ETH the token derives its value in three different ways : 1 ) as a capital asset ( for staking ) , 2 ) as pristine , trustless collateral for DeFi , and 3 ) as a commodity ( gas used for transactions ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  There obviously is a network effect as well for Ethereum , but it is those three characteristics that set it apart from all other crypto assets , and the reason why I believe that ETH will ultimately have the highest market cap ( even someday surpassing BTC ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Anytime is a good time to buy ETH as long as you are committed to hodling for at least 3 years , no matter what ( and this is easier said than done ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; There is no regulation on the supply of ETH tokens 

 EIP 1559 will make ETH 's monetary policy better than BTC 's .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  It 's just that with rollup tech on Ethereum , there wo n't be a need for them .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Anything parachains on Polkadot can do , for example , can be done on an L2 rollup on Ethereum , and with the added benefit of inheriting the security guarantees of Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I think these are the main advantages : 

 * L2 rollups inherit the security guarantees of the base L1 Ethereum chain .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`
 * L2 rollups have a closer integration with the Ethereum ecosystem , so you get all of the upside from the network effects that are already in place .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Open source ecosystems like Ethereum rely on volunteers to make it better .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Any time is a good time to buy ETH as long as you are committed to hodling for at least 3 years , no matter what ( easier said than done ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Any time is a good time to buy ETH as long as you are committed to hodling for at least 3 years , no matter what ( easier said than done ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  L2 rollup tech obsoletes the " Eth Killers " given that Ethereum L2s inherit the security guarantees of the base L1 Ethereum chain .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  For now , I 'd just start investing into more ETH on the new exchange , and leaving what you already have where it is .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;That being said if we want to further increase deflation we should also burn the ETH being made by 2.0 ETH stakers .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  There are so many " ETH killers " fighting among each other to be the next Ethereum , and while some of them may find a niche , I just do n't see any of them displacing Ethereum at this point .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I personally think BTC will scale on Ethereum more than it will be scaled by LN .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Reduces ETH issuance without reducing network security .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  It is the Ethereum network itself that makes Decentraland and other decentralized ecosystems possible .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  There is plenty of chatter among miners in Ethereum subs and elsewhere about how they can possibly subvert Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Remember ETH is still new and evolving .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`
 * Reduces ETH issuance without reducing network security .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`If a fork happens , that means that you can sell the fork and buy more ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  But much of what you come out with seems to come from a place of animosity and loathing , and I question whether you are invested in any way ( intellectually , emotionally , or monetarily ) in the success of Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Then , given that your aspirations to not align any long with Ethereum , perhaps you can pivot into Bitcoin mining .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;I do n’t expect the market will be kind to ETH 2.0 once the honeymoon period is over .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`This assumes that the ETH price stays constant , which is a dubious assumption .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The first thing that BTC maximalists and other Ethereum - adversaries teach to newcomers to the crypto space is that the supply of ETH is " infinite . "`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;this place 

 As in , the entire user ecosystem of Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  On Ethereum , it is mathematically provable that you own the copy .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`He also wanted the Ethereum Foundation to be a for - profit corporation ( one of the reasons for his original split from Ethereum ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`So Jeff buys up billions of $ worth of ETH , causing the price of ETH to skyrocket .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I can tell you this , if EIP 1559 is not merged , the price of ETH will plummet , along with your rewards .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`If you are committed to hodling for at least 3 years no matter what , then any time is a good time to buy ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`The SEC already openly stated that they thought the original Ethereum launch possibly involved an investment contract , but that they no longer consider ETH as security because it is sufficiently decentralized .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Also , Ethereum is resilient to 51 % attacks -- even more - so once the full transition to POS has been completed .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Whereas a Polkadot parachain inherits whatever security the Polkadot chain can muster , which is n't much , because DOT does not have monetary premium like BTC and ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;by trying to be an exact copy(minus the gas fees and block times ) 

 And minus the community , the network effects , and the security guarantees that Ethereum provides due to its monetary premium .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 Which is essentially what Ethereum L2 does .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The fact of the matter is , Ethereum is already scaling with L2 rollups , with Uniswap migrating within a month .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`The fact of the matter is , Ethereum is already scaling with L2 rollups , with Uniswap migrating within a month .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I think F2Pool is important to the medium - term future of Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  They are going to BSC because they are told it is just like Ethereum but cheaper .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  A better description would be : a ripoff of Ethereum plunked onto a centralized platform with illegitimate and shady apps , which have a high - likelihood of either rug - pulling you or getting shut down by the United States government .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 This would require the collusion of a majority of miners that would want to hurt Ethereum , which is unlikely , because it would be like shooting yourself in the foot .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  But let 's assume a cartel of miners did this , well then , the Ethereum community would view this as an attack on the network , and would move forward with the merge to full POS . 

 & gt ; They can actually fork the chain 

 Any non - EIP 1559 fork would receive zero users and no support from the DeFi community .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 & gt ; and biggest chain ( biggest hashrate ) becomes Ethereum , 

 This is where you have a misconception .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 What will happen is most miners will mine the EIP 1559 chain without trying to subvert Ethereum , because that will be in their best interests .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I just happen to think Ethereum is better , and POS will be good for Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The fees are pretty high right   now due to network congestion on Ethereum , but that is about to change in March as there are major upgrades / new scaling features coming .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`The issuance will be near - zero after 2.0 because the amount of ETH needed to compensate POS validators to secure the network is less than what is needed to pay POW miners .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  In addition , after EIP 1559 ( i.e. , an Ethereum upgrade ) is adopted this summer , there will be times that ETH emission is actually negative , particularly during times of network congestion .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  It 's just that when there is high congestion , the total amount of ETH being burned goes up .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`You can acknowledge that Ethereum is currently expensive to use , while at the same time explain to people that L2 rollup tech is about to scale Ethereum to 1000s of transactions / sec .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  They are completely 100 % focused only on scaling the Ethereum chain .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2 is less important now that L2 rollup tech is being adopted .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  They knew what was coming with L2 rollups on Ethereum , and they gave it their all to shift the narrative , which just was n't enough .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The other L1s will likely never displace ETH . 

 So again I ask , why would someone use something that is less secure when the cost / speed are not an issue ?`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator 

 Ethereum is / will be the most decentralized blockchain in the world , as it should be , given that it will be the settlement layer for the world .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`The difficulty bombs have played an important role in seeing that the Ethereum roadmap is executed .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`   The benefits of running a full node on Bitcoin do not equate to that of Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Given that it is the most used blockchain , by far , I think it is safe to assume that ETH will become deflationary , at least during periods at a time .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  All of the changes to Ethereum 's monetary policy have been to make it more sound .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Once Uniswap migrates to L2 ( it is happening ! ) , then the Ethereum L1 fees will drop considerably .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  My personal guess is that in the year 2130 or before , Bitcoin will ultimately adopt a fee burn mechanism / minimum viable issuance to secure the network framework similar to EIP 1559 , which is being adopted by Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  All of such subs ( minus a couple of miner subs ) , and all of Ethereum Twitter are demanding that the devs impalement EIP 1559 and POS .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  But I think nearly all users will dump it and buy more ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`ETH L2 has just as low fees , can do anything that any other L1 / L2 chain can do , and has the best security .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I suggest you sell your mining hardware for ETH while you can still command a premium , and then stake your ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 There is no way that POW on Ethereum will be here for anywhere near two years longer .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll bet my entire stack on Ethereum emerging intact with full POS .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I think you know little about what is actually happening right now in the ETH space .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  This is why BTC and ETH are the most economically secure blockchains .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The vast majority of DeFi is built on Ethereum because of this economic security .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Ethereum will soon be the most decentralized blockchain ( by far ) in the world .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure why Enjin did n't just migrate to Ethereum L2 like every other major DAPP and blockchain game is doing .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`The merge to full POS on Ethereum is now being prioritized over data sharding , because scaling is currently happening with L2 rollup tech ( thus , the need for sharding is not as pressing ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  These other " ETH killer " projects have their work cut out for them .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  ETH has value because 1 ) it is pristine , trustless collateral for the DeFi ecosystem , 2 ) it is become a digital - gold like store of value ( EIP 1559 ) , 3 ) it is a capital asset ( staking ) , and 4 ) it is a commodity ( gas for transactions ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`It means that ETH has become money .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  ETH is money because 1 ) it is the only pristine , trustless collateral for DeFi , 2 ) it is becoming a store of value ( EIP 1559 ) , 3 ) it is used to pay for gas for transactions , and 4 ) it generates an income stream if you save it ( staking ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`While anything is possible , at least consider that it is primarily newbs to the space that place credence in any of the supposed “ ETH Killers . ”`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`The main reason is that an Ethereum L2 can do anything any other L1 or L2 can do , but with better economic security .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Ethereum is becoming the final settlement layer for the world , and this is possible due to the monetary premium now being attributed to ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The problem is , the next 12 months of Ethereum innovation is about to blow the socks off of it .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`While anything is possible , the challenge that the " ETH killers " have including Algo is that they are up against massive network effects .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  And at the end of the day , an ETH L2 will be capable of doing anything any other L1 or L2 chain can do , but with better economic security .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  But when ETH takes the lead , there will be no point in referring to it any longer as an alt .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Keep in mind that one of the most common mistakes by newbs is to not own any BTC or ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 The fact that ETH is a good store of value makes it the most economically secure for DeFi and transactions .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The " ETH Killers " have their work cut out .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`If it ai n’t ultimately settled on Ethereum L1 , I do n’t risk a single gwei .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Anyone could participate then , just as anyone can participate in its wonders today by purchasing some ETH and staking it .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Every change in ETH 's monetary policy has always been to make it more sound .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Ethereum is the only chain committed to solving the trilemma .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  That is why you see DeFi on Ethereum , and why for the most part , it will remain so .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`

 At this point , if it is n’t tied directly to BTC or ETH , my interest level is near zero .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  100 nodes are n't sufficient to function as the settlement layer for the world , which is what Ethereum aims to be .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  It is projected that Ethereum 's max issuance will top out before \~120 M and gradually fall to around \~100 M over the next decade .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I hope you meant ETH not ETC .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;Hopefully we can get some proper discussion about what the   
 & gt ;  
 & gt;monetary policy should be once PoS is bedded in 

 The monetary policy on Ethereum has crystalized years ago under the principle of minimum viable issuance .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Miners are not going to be part of the Ethereum ecosystem going forward .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  It is estimated that the total outstanding ETH will gradually decrease from \~120 M to \~100 M over the course of the next decade or so .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  I 'm pretty sure the immutability of Ethereum has been established .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Now , if some fundamental protocol - level bug happened to threaten the Ethereum project again in a wide - ranging way , we have the comfort of knowing that layer 0 is made up of human beings , who can correct the code and see that the experiment moves forward .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;This is n't FUD - Ethereum does not deliver these things , if you want them then you 're not going to get them .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The supply matters just as much as the demand , even if you do n't know what the demand is . 

 & gt;PoS only distributes issuance to existing ETH holders , so it does n't destroy the value of the token in the same way that PoW issuance does , in fact it does n't reduce the wealth of the average ETH holder at all .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`If BTC maxis are simply decentralization maxis , then they 're going to love Ethereum 's merge to full POS , which will make Ethereum far more decentralized than Bitcoin .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  ETC was an ill - conceived attack on Ethereum from BTC maxis trying to stop Ethereum from succeeding .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure , but C.H. has also not wanted Ethereum to succeed .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  He also wanted the Ethereum Foundation to be a for - profit corporation .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  That said , I favor ETH over BTC .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I 've held ETH through two gut - wrenching bear markets and am very happy I did so .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  The most successful today is Polygon , and they will likely hold their importance given that they are Ethereum - native and working on all flavors of L2 .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Yes , by BTC maxis attempting to crush Ethereum in its infancy .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;ETC was a group that opposed the return of ( a lot of ) funds after the DAO hack 

 More specifically , ETC was a group of BTC maxis that attempted to discredit and crush Ethereum in its infancy .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Barry was a BTC maxi , and thought that Ethereum was going to somehow hurt Bitcoin .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll share a little free advice : get some ETH now before the updates come in July and December .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`But that nagging feeling is killin ' ya , which is why you are all over Ethereum .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`At least for ETH , not for long ( after switch to full POS later this year ) .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Try staking your ETH that you bought on RH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`  Oh wait , that 's right , you ca n't because you do n't actually own your ETH .`
Always_Question,favor,Ethereum,`Good cryptos do n't require memo B.S.   I suggest you stick with solid projects like BTC and ETH .`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 've just set up my £ 100 a week dca of eth on coinbase 

 I 've seen that they have announced last year that they will be introducing staking awards at some point this year 

 Does this mean that I 'll basically earn eth like how banks give you interest rates ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Apologies if this is nt the right place to ask 

 I used coinbase back in 2017 and had no issues at the time , recently got back into crypto and have set up a weekly dca for eth 

 I 'm a bit worried after seeing so many complaints about the service 

 Is there any better alternatives for the UK ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I just want to throw money at eth like the sexy stripper she is

Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`That 's the only thing I 'm grateful for , I sold litecoin near the all time high and it 's one of the few main ones which never got close to that ever again 

 Nice , seeing that eth and bnb must of been great`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Did nt go exactly as planned 

 Atleast eth is creeping up to 2k`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'll take 1k eth for it`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Which one of you guys made eth go under 2k ? 

 Show yourself`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah do nt sweat it 

 I think eth still has the potential to atleast double this bull run if not more`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Seems like $ 1969 is the new floor for eth 

 Would prefer it to be 2k though`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Looks like eth is playing how low can you go 

 Shall be buying that up in the morning`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Let 's hope so 

 At this rate it will be bitcoin to 200k and eth still at 1.9k`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I have some funds on my gbp account on coinbase but when I go to purchase eth it tries to take this from my card 

 How can I make the purchase using the funds on there ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I know I was glued to the charts at work Haha 

 Not sure if you saw the eth hitting 700 on kraken by error too 

 Some lucky sods who bought in for that price and some unlucky sods who had their stop limit hit by mistake`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I know your not psychic but where are you expecting eth to bottom out ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm 100 % eth and I do worry about this 

 I need to move it soon but those fees are crazy ( I do nt have enough to worry about that amount thankfully )`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Maybe a long shot but I 'm going to say 2k eth by the end of the day`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Thanks for the random redditor mentioning about coinbase pro 

 Ca nt believe how much cheaper the fees are 

 I paid almost £ 50 in fees for one eth on the standard app ... ouch`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Maybe some point in the future 

 I 'm all in eth but I think it depends on how eth 2.0 turns out and how quick`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Got a limit buy for eth at 1500 

 Seems like it might hit`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Such a conflicting feeling when you want eth to go up but also want it go down to get another limit order in`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Never thought I 'd see the day that ltc is doing better than eth and btc but here we are`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Btc I believe 

 Gas fees are pretty high right now for eth`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Was it only a week ago eth was at 2k ? 

 Time has been flying by 

 We will get back there my fellow hodlers`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm all in eth but I do agree with you that some people are like that 

 This is nt even just related to eth but some people treat their coins like a football club`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I think 100k will be the top this time round 

 Would loved to be proved wrong and it goes even higher but I 'm keeping my expectations in check 

 Same with 3k eth`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`This fighting over who has the best coin is getting a bit ridiculous really 

 I 'm all in on eth but some people take this way too personally when someone dares to mention about eth killers etc 

 If you believe in the project that you have invested in that should be enough 

 I 'm not saying everyone is like this but some of the comments remind me of a school playground`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Fair play 

 I hope your wrong in regards to 2k as I 'm all in eth but let 's see how it goes 

 Any particular reason you believe it wo nt reach it again this year ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Might be worth trying that on r / ethfinance on the daily mate 

 They have helped me with alot of eth based questions`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`No worries 

 When I first heard about it I literally just thought it meant that people were optimistic about eth in March haha`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Do nt want to jinx anything but seems like eth is holding up pretty well 

 I was convinced that when btc fell under 50k we were going under 1500 again`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Proud of eth for staying above 1500 today 

 Much better`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Hold the line eth !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Oh nice thanks 

 That 's a pretty decent return for just running your PC 

 Especially if eth continues to rise ( I hope )`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`C'm on eth 

 Let 's hit 2k this weekend`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Crypto is the only sport I enjoy 

 Ethereum is my manchester United`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I felt smart buying eth in the 1300 's a few weeks ago 

 $ 88 would be a dream come true 

 Hope you picked up some decent stuff in the sale ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm still new to it but I currently have eth in there 

 And dai for the stable coin`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Suprisingly enough its going to reach 22 degrees so i may have to get the sun cream out 

 Yeah i m all in eth so anything that helps ill take`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Lets get it eth ! 

 God damn`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Up 28 % in my eth so far 

 Got ta love it 

 Hope you peeps are doing as well or even better than me ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Were going to need someone to create some $ 2100 gifs for eth soon 

 I m 90 % sure we will hit that price today`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Do you think we have seen the last of $ 1900 eth for this bull run ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I m all in eth and i like seeing people celebrating gains with coins that i do nt even own just because its enjoyable`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I wonder if mark cuban increased his eth holdings from 30 %`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m all in eth but there is more of a potential for larger gains with other alts 

 But you also have a greater risk of it not paying off 

 I prefer a safer longterm investment but i understand why others would rather take the risk for bigger profits`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If you want a safe long term hold then eth 

 If your feeling risker and want larger gains i m sure someone will give your some`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`What s wrong bud ? 

 No complaints from me , suns out and eth is at 2k so life is pretty good for me atleast`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Its more personal preference with the wallets so do nt worry about that 

 Alt coins i would steer clear as you ca nt predict the long term value 

 Btc and eth are the only two coins that i recommend as safe long term holds but that s just my opinion so do your own research first`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`That s the plan 

 I m still buying eth each week regardless of what price it hits`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Morning peeps 

 Nice to see eth still holding up 2k !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`So looks like ill be getting some inheritance money next week 

 Dip or no dip ill be picking up some eth !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah 

 I m all in eth but i think its worth dcaing just incase future dips happen and you might be able to lower your average 

 Up to you though`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m bullish on eth but even i m pleasantly suprised that it is holding 2k 

 I thought it was going to take alot longer to make that the bottom 

 Looking forward to the next few months`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Perfect time to pick up some sub $ 2100 eth 

 Who would have thought that sounded like a bargain a few weeks ago`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Do nt let these people get to you 

 I m all in eth and buying the dip is a smart choice`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Oh nice 

 I only returned in February unfortunately so my profits are nt going to be life changing unless eth hits 10k ( which i doubt this bull run anyway ) but i m still in decent profit so i ca nt complain too much 

 Hope that all goes well`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Oh yeah i do nt mean to sound like a dick 

 I just do nt think there is such thing as easy money as chasing fomo rarely pays off 

 If your new i would recommend sticking to btc and eth`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Looking to get back into the dating scene ones the lockdown restrictions are lifted 

 How soon do i bring up that i own eth to impress the ladies ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`This may just be wishful thinking on my part but i m accumulating as much eth as i can before the berlin upgrade in july 

 I m expecting big things and i m sure i am not alone in this !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I feel partly responsible for calling 2k eth the bottom recently 

 Sorry guys and girls`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Well damn 

 I suppose i should pay attention more rather than focusing on the eth chart`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I m currently using Celsius for my eth and i m happy with it but keeping that sort of money in there would worry me`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m all in eth so that s my answer haha 

 Ltc made me big gains in 2017 , eth in 2021 will be the same ( fingers crossed anyway )`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I would 

 I m all in and bullish on eth but i think its worth dcaing for sure`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Morning all , if anyone recognises me you might remember that i will be getting some inheritance money soon and due to the banks taking a while its finally confirmed that ill be getting it next week 

 I m currently 100 % eth and ill be picking some up when it arrives but i was wondering if there are any coins with some upside potential that you think it might be worth looking into ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Am i overly optimistic that i m expecting 4k eth some point this year ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m all in on eth but i would n't call them idiots 

 I understand the frustration`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Almost had to sell all my eth today ( family issue ) 

 Thankfully i no longer have to part with my coins 

 Could nt leave you guys !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`The great thing about being all in on eth 

 When eth hits a new all time high 

 So does my gains !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Woke up an hour before my alarm 

 Just in time to see eth hit $ 2500 possibly ? 

 This is exciting stuff !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m 100 % eth 

 I m happy for the people making gains with doge though`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`For all my eth heads 

 Berlin upgrade will be live in four hours if you were not aware !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I do nt think its going to have a huge effect on price as of yet but its a step in the right direction for the eventual eth 2.0 in the future`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Email or text telling you about a new online wallet thing and offering $ 500 worth of free cel 

 When you went to register it , as far as i m aware it asked you for your seed 

 They have now received over 100 + eth unfortunately`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Your going to get different answers depending on who owns what 

 I m all in eth so my answer would be biased 

 If your interested in both 50/50 sounds like a smart choice`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Remember when some people were posting that ada was going to take over eth ? 

 All quiet now eh`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`To clarify i have nothing against ada 

 This is the people who were convinced it was going to overtake eth in marketcap`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`People downvoting eth comments it seems 

 Do nt be jealous !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`No one saw this coming though 

 If i put in all of my money that i have in eth into doge in the same timeframe i would be a millionaire right now 

 Do nt regret the past mate`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Still pretty amazing to see eth in the $ 2400 range 

 I knew it would happen eventually but not this quickly`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I did nt even realise you could do this with moons 

 I m assuming you mean that you convert it to something else 

 I m all in on eth but that s only a 5.05 % apy but better than nothing`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`[ gif](giphy|tZIFVKGGVUlna ) 

 The doge community right now watching the rest of our portfolios 

 I m guessing some people are selling btc and eth to throw into it ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I know they joke about it on their daily but i m convinced that $ 1 doge is not a meme anymore 

 Now imagine if those crazy folk put their profits into btc and eth`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If i threw all my eth gains into doge last month i would be a millionaire now 

 Its nice to daydream at work about what my life would be like if i did make that decision`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I told a colleague of mine that he was stupid and was going to lose all of his money and should invest it into legitimate projects like eth as an example 

 Guess who the stupid one is now !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Does anyone know why the 1d chart on binance for eth as an example shows 1545 as the bottom ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Good evening guys and girls 

 Was nice to take a bit of a break and hang out with some mates at the park in sunny london 

 Currently sunburnt and looks like the eth chart is too for now 

 Hope you have all had a good day though !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If anyone actually sold yesterday by pure luck and managed to buy eth when hit $ 1950 or less then well played 

 Do we think this is because of doge or just a correction that was pretty inevitable at some point ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Kind of gutting when you do nt have any spare fiat to purchase eth in the dip 

 Just got ta watch from the sidelines and cheer it on 

 Happy for those of you who did buy the dips for whatever coins you own though`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Never seen you round here before 

 As someone who is 100 % eth i think we could be friends !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m hoping we do nt dip that hard again but if anyone wants some discount eth it might be worth putting some limit buys in the $ 1900 range just incase 

 I m out of fiat so i ca nt take advantage if it does but its something to think about 

 You ll thank yourself after i m sure of it`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Never heard of it either 

 If you can get her to ask the spirits what year eth will hit 10k i would appreciate it`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I think it will 

 I m bullish and 100 % eth but i think $ 1900 or so is very likely 

 Just wish i had spare fiat to buy some more if / when it does`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I do nt think we are there yet so i am not worried 

 But lets say that this was the start of the bear market , what would your plan be ? 

 For me i would carry on dcaing and buying eth like my life depends on it 

 Just curious on how many folks would stick around and how you would use it to your advantage`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If you believe in eth long term like i do then you ll know that this is still a decent entry point 

 Of course $ 1900 range would be nice but $ 2k eth is still a bargain in my personal opinion`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If you can time it sure 

 Lets say you bought eth at $ 2200 and sold at 21 and then rebought at 19 as an example 

 But its always tricky timing that sort of thing so i always hold`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Covid test came back negative and eth is on the slow and steady rise back to $ 2300 

 Nice start to my monday !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Hi guys and girls 

 I m all in eth and i have a decent chunk of it in Celsius earning 5.05 % apy which is better than nothing 

 I ve heard about these large apy 's using pancakeswap etc 

 I m assuming they are alot more risky ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 Just trying to earn some free eth with what i have but i do nt want something where i will be stressing about a rugpull or something`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure if its just me but its starting to feel like gme in here 

 When s the eth short squeeze happening ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I know what you mean but i think its a good thing to let people enjoy their gains 

 I can guarantee me and many others will be doing it when eth moons again 

 Same with others with different coins , just the way it is really`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If he bought eth in December he should still be up considerably so i hope he listened 

 I have a mate who bought into safe moon and is making thousands , until they lose money its hard to convince them otherwise`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I believe so 

 Coinbase actually take some off but obviously for most people it is more convenient 

 Currently i have a chunk of my eth Celsius earning interest`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Is it just me who hates having non full numbers of coins ? 

 Say for example you had 1.7 btc 

 Not going to say how much i have but i m currently sitting at 0.2 away from another full eth and it bugs me for some weird reason and i m half tempted to buy it just to satisfy my ocd`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`That s what i do nt understand 

 Its crazy 

 Maybe i was the idiot all along buying eth when i should have been buying the memes`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Listening to taylor swift - 22 ( do nt judge me ) 

 I m hoping eth feels like $ 2200 too`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Full portfolio of eth mate 

 I believe in it so thought why not 

 Paying off so far and i am looking forward to the future`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone got any dance moves we can do to get the hype going for btc and eth ? 

 Post it on tiktok and bam 

 That seems to be the trick these days`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Days like this make me happy to be 100 % eth 

 It has nt been an easy journey but its a damn worthwhile one !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If you can guarantee that you wo nt need to take profits before eth 2.0 releases ( we do nt have an official date yet ) then go ahead 

 My plan is to put 50 % in staking when rocket pool releases and the rest split in Celsius and my wallet just incase i need or decide to sell some`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m bullish on eth but i would n't guarantee we are out of the woods yet 

 Maybe $ 1950 is a good shout ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m bullish and all in eth but i would dca it 

 We have had a great run but it would nt suprise me to see some form of pullback or we could keep going 

 Obviously if you put it all in and it carries on going up you ll be loving it but if it dips you ll be glad you dca'd 

 Say $ 100 or $ 200 a week as an example 

 Up to you though mate !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Enjoy mate 

 You ll be known as the local lad shilling eth in the pub toilets soon`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Quite a few in this sub bought back in march when btc was 3k and eth was $ 80 

 They stayed patient but it paid off that s for sure`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m all in eth but it has been super quiet in respect of bitcoin lately 

 Are newcomers actually buying it or sticking with alts ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I felt like treating myself after looking at my eth gains 

 Luckily i still have the metabolism of my teenage self despite turning 30 this year`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Woke up to see bitcoin shitting the bed one again 

 Happy to see eth holding up well regardless !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Last bull run i was 100 % ltc and this bull run it is 100 % eth 

 I m not one for diversifying but it usually pays off regardless`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`New all time high for my portfolio too 

 I m 100 % eth so its a double celebration 

 Congrats to any other holders here ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`As a guy with 100 % eth i am loving this but i hope btc follows suit soon 

 If btc crumbles below 50k its bad news for all of us`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Every time i see eth rising i think of you haha 

 I m glad you still held on to quite a few`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Depends 

 If eth rises will you need the profits at some point ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m planning on half 

 Because i want to put a deposit on a house eventually and if eth hits 5k ( i hope ) being able to take some out is my plan`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Still time mate 

 This bull run still has legs 

 I wish i bought eth back when it hit $ 80 when lockdown started but no point regretting the past`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Ca nt believe we hit $ 2600 

 This is insane haha 

 22/04/2021 will forever be known as eth day`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Can someone explain something to me 

 Will there ever be a point in crypto where bitcoin is nt the deciding factor on how alts will rise / lose ? 

 See ethereum as an example right now , despite hitting the $ 2600 range and rising separately to btc , when it dips alot eth inevitably does too`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Despite bitcoin going down to 52k seeing eth just under $ 2500 is great stuff`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Do you remember the memes on here a month or so ago about bitcoin reaching 200k and eth still sitting at $ 1900 

 Crazy how things change so quickly`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Shame it ended on a bit of a downer but what a great day for eth regardless 

 That was exciting stuff 

 Good night everyone , buy the dip if you can and i expect to see green when i wake up 

 Take care ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Thought i got a late night message from a girl that i like 

 Turns out it was coinbase informing me that eth is down 13.5 % ❤`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Losing 30 % gains overnight is never fun but it is what it is 

 I know eth will make its come back along with the rest of the market in due course 

 Just wish i could afford to throw in more fiat but i can only pick up a little bit more for now 

 Hope everyone is doing ok especially you new guys`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`So yesterday i barely got any work done because i was watching eth rocket 

 Now i am going to be keeping an eye on bitcoin 

 My productivity has been awful`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah 100 % 

 Problem is imagine selling and then it shoots up even higher 

 Its a tricky situation 

 I m still up in crypto but if i sold when eth hit 2600 i would have had some nice change 

 Could rebuy right now for alot more`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Big bonus coming for me next month 

 So buy eth now because i can guarantee when that money hits my account we will have a new ath before i get a chance to put it in`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I m all in eth and have an amount i m happy with but i do nt know wether to just sit back and relax or keep buying despite increasing my average by doing so 

 When i joined in 2017 i literally bought 1k worth of litecoin which i x6 and then i sold so this is my first proper bull run where i have been dcaing and buying dips throughout 

 I m not asking for someone to tell me what to do i m just curious what your moves are 

 Cheers ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`When i was here in 2017 i sold in December and this was around the time that friends and colleagues etc started buying and i missed the 2018 crash 

 I regrettably only returned in early February but because of putting in alot when eth dipped to the £ 900 range i m still up a decent amount thankfully 

 Part of me feels that i wo nt get that lucky twice and i have noticed the same things happening in my social circle which is causing me concern 

 I m not planning on selling for a while but i m not going to pretend that it is nt on my mind after what happened last time`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`$ 2500 eth by valentine 's day 

 We stil have 10 months`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If stacking bitcoin is classed as sats 

 What can us eth heads call the same thing ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`50k btc is basically $ 2000 eth 

 We will break it eventually guaranteed 

 Just frustrating to watch`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`You earn free eth basically 

 But be warned that it will be locked until 2.0 releases ( we have no official date yet ) 

 So if you will need to take profits at some point in the near future you wo nt be able to if you stake all of it`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m 100 % ethereum and as much as i would love that to happen alot will need to change before that s a possibility 

 I m sure if you asked your parents they will know or have heard what bitcoin is , if you said the same about eth they would have no clue 

 So maybe ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`You already summed it up i think 

 I m 100 % eth which makes life easier`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Not sure if anyone missed the news but i only just found out 

 Celsius are going to be adding eth staking within the next week or two , 8 % apy and will be locked until 2.0 releases 

 Probably going to wait for rocketpool myself but just a heads up`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I believe it changes over time until eth 2.0 releases 

 It was on their ama the other day`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I want to own one btc at some point just to be part of the exclusive club 

 Saying that i m all in eth currently so ill wait for the bear market`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Funny thing is that could actually pay off with how this year is going 

 Sell at the peak and rebuy eth`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`You wo nt find many 

 There is only one true eth`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`The only downside to being 100 % eth is that i am never satisfied with the amount i have 

 Always wanting more and more`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Rather than tipping moons i will tip eth 

 My future goal`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m not sure if i m the only one who does this but everytime eth hits a new number i get super excited and then the novelty wears off 

 $ 2600 is amazing but now i m bored and want $ 2700`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Morning all 

 Ca nt believe i missed 2.7k eth when i was asleep 

 Hopefully we can gat back there again soon`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Those who wanted to wait for eth to slow down before grabbing more 

 Looks like you will have your chance soon 

 Slow dip`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Btc and eth 

 Ca nt go wrong 

 Dca though , say 50 quid into both per week as an example`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If anyone told me a month ago we would be this close to £ 2000 eth in april there is no way i would have believed it 

 Crazy times eh !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I do nt own any but as much as i m enjoying seeing eth at $ 2700 i just know that if bitcoin breaks 50k again its going to fuck up the market for the rest of us 

 I sure hope it can get going again`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I m all in eth 

 I would advise dcaing into it though , especially at this price point`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`[ gif](emote|eth2_emote|eth2 ) 

 But i agree , maybe its a subconscious thing but owning whole coins is strangely satisfying to me 

 Saying that one day i do hope to own a whole bitcoin but now i m 100 % eth`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Btc sitting at 53k whilst eth is at 2.7k 

 Crazy times we are in 

 Just need the daddy to pull his finger out already otherwise the market is going to take another big dump`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I have got so used to seeing eth in the green that even a -1 % is dissapointing to me 

 Tut tut`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Good morning guys and girls 

 Ca nt believe eth is at $ 2850 

 I m actually so happy haha`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I use Celsius 5.05 % 

 The good thing about them is that you can withdraw for free at any time 

 So depends if you are going to want to take profits before eth 2.0 is released as staking it will lock it`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`My mum called me earlier and asked what I did with my grandparents inheritance money 

 I wanted to tell her that I threw most of it into eth but I knew she would kill me despite it paying off considerably haha 

 " Its in a savings account mum do nt worry "`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`You do n't have to put all your eth in there 

 You could always put some into Celsius and then you can withdraw at any time`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Dca into btc and eth 

 Would not recommend just throwing it all in at once`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Everytime I think eth is slowing down we hit another all time high 

 I 'm 100 % eth so this has been an amazing Saturday`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Nice of eth to let us Europeans sleep and dip so we all get a chance to watch $ 3000 today ! [ gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dyor )`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Been so busy watching eth I did n't even realise the moon price going up !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I do agree with that for the most part but it depends on what you are actually buying 

 I believe in eth in the short and long term and it has paid off significantly !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`You just know someone is scrambling to be the first person to post about 3k eth on the homepage for that sweet karma haha`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Been another great day for eth but its time to call it a night for me 

 Hopefully I will wake up to 3k celebrations 

 Take care guys and girls ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I hope some of you here bought eth at $ 80 last march and still have some ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`For my British eth holders 

 We just hit £ 2300 !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Morning all 

 Was out all day yesterday and did n't check the charts till just now 

 Ca n't believe eth hit $ 3457 ! 

 Great to see it at the $ 3300 range though ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm up 100 % too 

 Still holding though 

 I think eth has a way to go yet`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm loving and terrified at the same time watching eth haha 

 Ca nt believe how fast its moving`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Ca nt say I 'm too suprised about the eth dip 

 If I was smart I would have sold and tried to rebuy 

 But I 'm useless at that sort of thing so I just relax and hold !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Ca nt tell if your being serious to be honest haha 

 But btc and eth are no brainers`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Got ta sell one of my eth soon :( 

 Little tip for any of you younger folks who wear braces , when you take them off make sure to use your retainers 

 I 'm now 30 and need to pay for those invisible braces haha`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I have been thinking of doing the same 

 I 'm 100 % eth and I 'm still bullish as fuck so I ca n't seem to press the button to sell even though I have doubled it and more haha`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Good morning guys and girls 

 Nice to see that we hit a new eth ath whilst I was asleep !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I would say that 's a decent portfolio yes 

 I 'm 100 % eth but I have heard good things about ada too`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Depends if you will want to take profits before eth 2.0 is released 

 We have no official date so imagine if you locked up all of your coins in and eth hit 10k for example , you would n't be able to sell`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I know on binance you can see the next few 100 's with eth as an example 

 But I 'm curious if there is one at 5k and so on`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`That site is so satisfying to watch 

 Some legend just bought 2.9 million worth of eth ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If you actually use a wheelchair please tell me you have styled it with eth logo 's`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Owning only one crypto ( eth ) means I just get to chill and enjoy the show when you guys are making your gains 

 Happy to see so many of you enjoying the day ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I feel like I 'm doing a service haha 

 Just convinced some guy from throwing his money away into some random shitcoin and told him to look at btc and eth instead 

 I remember how overwhelming crypto was at first and I just wanna help them`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`It has been amazing couple of weeks for us eth holders 

 Let 's hope it keeps going ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Yeah I lost alot of unrealised gains thanks to gme which hurt but there is no point regretting the past 

 Stay positive , eth still has a way to go in my opinion and you have an amazing entry point 

 Alot of us would dream about getting in that low`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`No date on eth 2.0 though just to make you aware 

 Maybe wait till Sunday to see if we dip ? 

 With the whole doge snl thing I think this weekend could be an interesting one`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Goodnight guys and girls 

 Been a pretty crazy day but was nice to see eth hit a new all time high again 

 Hopefully some normality will be resumed tomorrow with a certain coin going down ( if you know you know ) 

 Take care and may green candles be in your portfolios !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Wish my mate was as smart as yours 

 He s a safemoon boy , I tried to convince him to put his profits into eth but he refuses to sell`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I 've seen people talking about eth hitting 10k but I just ca n't see it happening this cycle 

 Would love to be wrong though`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Will they jump into the main coins though that s the only question 

 I do nt own any doge , eth classic , safemoon etc but I can see the appeal 

 Why use your profits to buy bitcoin or eth when you can just find the next small cap and potentially get a 10x return in a few months 

 Its an interesting time and I hope the money flows into legitimate projects but time will tell`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I wonder how much eth I could get for that`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`When my future kids ask me why we can afford to own a yacht and our luxurious lifestyle 

 I will tell them 

 " Daddy bought eth when it was below 10k "`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Do n't really understand what this means 

 But I 'm all in eth and my gains are great !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`If your planning to hold long term then its a no brainer 

 But can you guarantee that you wo n't want to take any profits before eth 2.0 is released ?`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`

 I 'm planning on staking half of mine as I would like the option to take some profits if eth moons`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`But yeah I would n't class those two as particularly risky compared to some but eth has alot of potential and btc is something that I recommend newcomers to hold even though I do nt own any myself`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I know this wo n't happen but I love the idea of the doge lot sitting around watching snl expecting elon to talk about it 

 Instead he brings out a special guest ( our man vitalik ) 

 They talk about eth and bam we hit 5k+ haha`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Btc starts the move and eth follows 

 You love to see it 

 60k and 3.6k 

 Let 's get it !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Watching nobody ( cracking film by the way ) 

 Hard to concentrate when eth is pumping like mad though`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Good night peeps 

 Been an amazing Saturday for us eth holders 

 Glad to see bitcoin doing well too and hopefully can break 60k soon 

 I 'm curious to see what the doge situation will look like when I wake up 

 Take care ! [`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`As many of you will probably know i m all in eth and I have been bullish for months 

 But I was still cautious and expected 5k to be the peak this cycle 

 I am starting to realise that maybe I have been too bearish and that we will more than likely go much higher than that`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I d rather put what I have spare into eth 

 But you do you , those sort of things are too risky for me 

 Plus joining now you have missed the main pump , you need to get extremely lucky`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm all in and still wish I had more 

 Will never have enough eth unfortunately`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Were not hating on it 

 Its the people coming here to laugh at others which we hate 

 I would n't come to the doge daily and tell you to buy eth !`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I know 

 Ca nt believe eth is n't at 10k yet :(`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Started in 2017 actually haha 

 Still did n't think I would wake up to 4k eth this morning`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`I 'm all in eth and I do nt feel the need to diversify personally 

 I always recommend newcomers to own some but I just choose not to`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Has there been any press about eth hitting 4k ? 

 Usually when bitcoin reaches a new milestone i will hear about it on the BBC or something 

 But I suppose most people will have no idea what it is`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Despite being all in eth I still feel like I do nt have enough 

 Not a bad problem to have in the grand scheme of things I suppose`
Nomorealcohol2017,favor,Ethereum,`Just want to give a big shout out to my boy u / deedot11 

 I remember when people were screaming that eth is dead about two months ago he was posting that this was the perfect point to pick some up and about it being a great accumulation phase 

 Glad I listened because I threw in a lump sum and I am way up now ! [`

Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`You ’ll see these parts referred to as Shards , but again , you do not need to do anything with your ETH 1.0 for ETH 2.0 .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 We suddenly lost my dad in October , he got in to Ether in 2017 and had recently reached the 32ETH that he wanted to stake .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Metamask is great for Ethereum and DEFI , Argent is pretty cool too .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`This is not a good day to short ETH , not matter how brave you are .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 5 years could be an extremely good hold for ETH , just ride out the volatility .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 That ’s why no one really knows until the ETH futures prices start to come out .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Naysayers do n’t quite understand that gas fees are high because _ everyone wants to use the Ethereum blockchain _ and will pay a lot to do so because they are still making great returns .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`The aim of EIP1559 is to improve the user experience of using ETH .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 The burn function is to protect against attacks , but it also has the secondary effect of making ETH inflation drastically reduced , perhaps to deflation .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Hope you slept well ! 

 2k ETH must have invaded my dreams because I woke up a few minutes after and obviously could n’t get back to sleep after checking prices while taking a slash .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`The St Louis Federal Reserve thought it was worth publishing a detailed research article on decentralised finance , which is almost exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain at present .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`People value ETH on what it can do and all ‘ ETH killers ’ on what they might be able to do in the future .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Okay , why not make miners happy with an increase in block reward and then burn all tx fees in every block ? 

 Why not throw users a bone ? 

 The point is that Ethereum does n’t do upgrades to throw anyone a bone .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 I think the same greed means that the vast majority of miners would continue to mine Ethereum after 1559 without any concessions because _ it will still be profitable to mine _ .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Please do not attack any one section or group of actors motives in our Ethereum world , just make sound arguments for why they are wrong .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Guaranteed increase in revenue of 50 % just in case there is a drop in revenue from EIP1559 of 30 % and then potentially a ETH price drop to a level that makes mining unprofitable which then might incentivise an unknowns number of miners move elsewhere .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Miners will receive a 2 ETH block reward following EIP1559 , this EIP increases it to 3 . 

 Is someone proposing this EIP without the implementation of 1559 and the expected drop in miner revenue ?`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`You ’re ignoring that 1559 has been included for the London fork and the status quo from then will be 2 ETH rewards .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`You are ignoring 1559 by basing your block reward net calculations on Ethereum as - is prior to the London upgrade .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Or are you suggesting that block rewards should be net reduced by 1 ETH regardless of where the calculation starts ?`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`So you ’re assuming that 1559 is guaranteed to increase ETH price ?`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`I do n’t think it sets a good precedent though , and miners have yet to demonstrate that 2 ETH is actually below MVI .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Can you demonstrate that 2 ETH rewards + unburned fees + MEV does not provide enough profit for miners to stay with Ethereum ?`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Miners need to make profits , and Ethereum has a long standing minimum viable issuance policy meaning that miners should be profitable but the rest of the network should not over - pay .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 The current threat is that miners will either leave Ethereum and mine another coin , or move their hash power so that one pool has 51 % of the total power and could then use the mining power in their pool to change the ledger .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`All calculations show that ETH will still be profitable to mine after 1559 .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 If you think 1559 makes ETH unprofitable to mine , please show us some calculations .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH ’s consensus mechanism is not to be used to help miners sell on their approachingly redundant equipment , but the wording of this EIP suggests that the author sees it that way .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 3668 is still above minimum viable issuance and no one has prepared an argument for why 2 ETH + fees + MEV is insufficient .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`& gt;Oh I think Ethereum will survive just fine with EIP 1559 and MEV .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`We do n't have any examples of how this shift in mining / monetary policy   to burning fees will play out with real world market forces 

 Almost everything Ethereum has achieved was risky , untested in production and as such was mostly heavily researched and modelled beforehand .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`For now Ethereum remains more profitable but with Raven prices increasing at a growth rate far beyond Etherum and the reduction in fees going to miners it reasons to stand that Raven may very well start eating away at some of Ethereum 's hashrate and that gap could be entierly obliterated in time to come .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 In any case , 1559 does not mean that ETH will be deflationary .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`You could have 2ETH rewards and 1 ETH burned , net inflation would be +1 . 

 Your immature attacks on devs only detracts from your comments , I know there ’s a ‘ greedy miners ’ narrative but neither are helpful .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`For anyone wondering why Visa chose Ethereum for the majority of their USDC project despite current high fees , it is because of Ethereum ’s legitimacy as a decentralised and credibly neutral blockchain .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Can you show me one project on BSC that has n’t been copied from and existing Ethereum project ? 

 BSC and ETH are different solutions for different things , I was just highlighting why decentralisation is important , even to giant centralised companies like Visa .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`RPL for when Rocketpool decentralised ETH staking launches`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 That said , I disagree on the ETH price action but I did n’t downvote .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`ETH does n’t market to newbies like TRX & amp ; BNB so do n’t expect the same effects .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 People might hear about ETH before others because of its legitimacy as a decentralised smart contract platform and market cap .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`After trying to roll back the BTC chain and trying to shit on the ETH chain , I do not trust CZ or Binance whatsoever .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`There ’s a distinction between hyping your own project and shitting on others , Hoskinson has been trying to paint Ethereum as about to be killed by Cardano for a long time .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`The Merge coming in the next 12 months , making Ethereum the green blockchain .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 The improvements will make it much easier for wallet software to predict accurate gas prices for a swift tx confirmation and part of that requires some ETH to be burned .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Back in 2017 I put £ 75 of ETH aside for each of them , it is now worth ~£800 .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH has n’t gone parabolic yet , but when it does I think it will go much further and faster than most of us expect .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`I can not wait for someone to build the Moon Bet Bot . 

 Syntax like ‘ I bet X moons ETH will be $ Xxxx in X hours ’ which spins up a contract for the moons to be sent to and then anyone can take the otherside of the bet by sending the same amount of moons .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`It is them , they seem to be not owning any ETH .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Galaxy are scrapping their ETH ETF for Doge due to not enough demand .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Around $ 1000 people were saying we ’d never see sub $ 100 ETH , it still happened , twice .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 You could be right this time but $ 2k is still fairly recent , ETH only broke through it for the first time 2 months ago .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Yep , guess what the Ethereum marketing budget is too , $ 0 and there is no marketing team .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`It incentivises people with the know how to mix their ETH with others to create and run more validators .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`It makes it very easy for anyone with any amount of ETH to stake it and receive rETH in return .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`No staked ETH will be as valuable as unstaked ETH because of the risks involved with staking .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`I think it is still on test net , do n’t send any real ETH to test net wallets ! 

 You can get involved with the beta using free test net ETH , there are faucets around .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`You ’re assuming a lot will happen there , and that ETH wo n’t take off while you ’re in DOGE .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Goldman Sachs think that BTC ’s value proposition is flimsy in light of Ethereum .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`ETH open leveraged interest was much lower than BTC , that is why it handled the dip better .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH is a triple point asset and JPM as well as Goldman Sachs are talking about it in public now , probably after filling their bags .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Visa are settling B2B USD transactions on Ethereum , the European Investment Bank is issuing bonds on Ethereum , MasterCard are hiring Ethereum devs as well as Visa , JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs suggest that Ethereum had a much brighter future than BTC .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 I do n’t like the idea of getting to August and everyone wetting their pants because millions of ETH have n’t been burned yet .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Watch for the crypto market cap going parabolic , or BTC and/or ETH simultaneously .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`There ’s a no bullshit legit projection that long term puts ETH towards $ 150k 

 I ’m not yet convinced we ’ll see that in 5 - 10 years , but I can definitely see $ 40k or more in that time .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`ETH is like Snowpiercer starting to pick up speed , you want to be on this train .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Lido offer a service where you receive stETH in proportion to the ETH you stake , this can be used in some defi applications .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is so well built and legitimate that continental investment banks are keen to release their bonds on it .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`His hearing must still be on point because he must have picked up that Ethereum is an ultra sound asset .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Staking for ETH2.0 is actually used to run validators whereas locked up ETH such as deposits on yielding platforms is just locked up in defi , not staked .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`So instead of burning up lots of electricity through computing power as seen in proof of work , the skin in the game is ETH as collateral .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 When people are whinging that BTC is moving without ETH , that ’s the time to buy .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`BTC is dirt cheap today , ETH is still undervalued .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 BTC has social advantages in that its narrative is widespread and brand well known , I think BTC and ETH liquidity are broadly at parity .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`‘ My grandson made a fortune on something called Ethereum , there ’s a cheaper version called Ethereum Classic just about to take off . ’`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`I think anyone selling ETH before the London upgrade in July is just helping out the institutions .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Do it if you need the money , otherwise , lets make the institutions pay their fair way for our precious ETH .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`JP Morgan sees ETH going to 10.5k this cycle , if you ’re happy with more than doubling your ETH go with that .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 First is that there is much more ETH being locked up in the ETH2 staking contract than is being minted each day .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`This ETH is locked until sometime next year when the merge to ETH2.0 is complete .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Where miners need to sell ETH to pay for their running costs , validators have no where near the same fixed costs , so they will not need to sell ETH and can accumulate by talking part in the network .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`JP Morgan sees ETH going to 10.5k this year .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`I ’d love it if those funds got converted to ETH and were then donated to a DAO that could reimburse people who can prove on chain that they were victims of a scam or rug pull .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`

 Its funny how you ’re complaining about the success and popularity of Ethereum as a reason to say it has failed .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`For that it needs documentation , tooling , templates , etc etc etc . 

 I hope Cardano is a success but it has a few hundred marathons to do before it catches up with Ethereum and stems the flow of ETH dominance .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Last cycle there was EOS , NEM , NEO blah blah blah , none of them stopped ETH reaching 35 % dominance .`
Papazio,favor,Ethereum,`Stop whinging and go trust Binance with all your money then , you clearly do n’t understand the blockchain trilemma or why Ethereum block space is so valuable .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`
 ETH is centralized with Vitalik God playing central banker and upgrade path is risky ... and POS is not secured ...`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`using a counter party or using pure smart contract logic ? 

 The latter meaning the check out Bitcoin address is an input to the smart contract and resides in the ETH blockchain .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`how do you know which ether belongs to that 51 percent ?`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`ETH coins will decide which tx is valid and which is not .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH , we will see .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`But the game theory tells us ETH pos will fail .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 they think ETH pos will magically solve the trilemma . and others shit coins they bought with hopium .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`I know for sure ETH pos will be attacked .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 BTW i have some eth .. just for fun .. well its not fun to use because of gas .. computing it is a chore .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Its just visible now with ETH because every moon boy think ETH is a magic bullet .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Now prove the world that no single cartel owns 51 % of those staking ETH .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`they want people to think Ethereum can stay decentralized so people keep buying into it .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`the problem with ETH is that its going away from POW .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH too but the POS downgrade kills its long term security .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`he responsed because Ripple lied about ETH saying it was chineese controlled .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`I see a snake selling his centralized coin by using ETH .. 

 remember .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`i am no prophet .. 

 market info is async 

 did n't know about ETH futures news .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`according to your logic , since regulatory breaches know no statute of limitations , Vitalik and other entities that can be identified , by creating ETH using an ICO token will also be a target of the SEC ? 

 Logic right ?`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 Vitalik will get sued by the SEC down the road for starting ETH as an unregistered security .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; The SEC announced ETH is not a security years ago 

 They said the current iteration of POW ETH is not .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 my conclusion is that it wo n't fix the fees and its just a clever way of burning ETH to pump the price up by making it more scarce .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 How is that not centralization ? 

 After awhile a cartel will form and they will own Ethereum once and forever .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`haha imagine 20k eth .. 

 so that means 200 usd for using a smart contract 

 muh use case ! !`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`the funny thing is that Miners are one part of the equation to the success of Ethereum .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`He also said Ethereum may have been a security in its early days , but has grown more decentralized over time .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum was supposed to be oil for smart contracts .. 

 now they are just trying to pump the bags of the whales .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum does not know what it wants to be .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`this proves ETH heads are just recycling BTC memes .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 oil for running cars = ether for running contracts 

 Eth pumpanoics 

 Lets make oil super rare so eth holders get super rich .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 Now Eth heads think ETH is sound money for the real SOV .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`I am excited to see 5k ETH and its use case of smart contracts completely crumble in front of the eyes of all the noobs .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; Ethereum is computationally universal , which gives it absolute versatility .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 State can be attacked because with the pruned Ethereum node state has been irrelevant after a few block .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`  This is possible on Ethereum and only Ethereum because Vitalik is God 

 Try to use any smart contract and be ready to fork out 100 USD of value just to use it .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 You ca n't access anything from L1 Ethereum without paying L1 fees .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 Buying Ethereum is making those preminers rich .. 

 The SEC hammer will go down on them .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`its even worse since i learned a few days ago that Ethereum was premined with 72 millions tokens ! ! !`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`We will see if Ethereum is really decentralized and not just a SharkDuck running on AWS and Infura .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`that article illustrates that the ETH devs now know they are in a deathmatch for the SOV use case .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; Over all , she 's young and quite conservative as an investor hence her parroting the ' safe ' bet cause it 's a SoV. So is ETH but more so ... 

 is ETH the best SOV in the world ?`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 When ETH 2.0 is out of alpha and proves that POS can survive a fork political fight over monetary policy .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`So anyone who shits on XRP because of the premine should look at Ethereum with equal honesty .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 And well I agree Ethereum provides a service .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Vitalik himself said at first that inflation was needed to keep the price low and that Ethereum was not competing with Bitcoin .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`ironic that Ethereum will become like Bitcoin : a settlement layer 

 In this case , a settlement layer for the many L2 sidechains .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 Anyone with 50 - 100 usd worth of assets is priced out of the ecosystem forever because of the SOV pivot for Ethereum .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`glad to see Ethereum is not full of coke heads .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`the more ether price goes up , the more fees go up .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`In practice ETH shows that s not possible .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 after reading comments here , my conclusion is that Binance Smart Chain is the Ethereum killer .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 POW & gt ; POS 

 ETH devs correctly analyzed that ETH would never overtake Bitcoin thermodynamics .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; In that way I ’d say ETH is more like a stock that appreciates because the underlying ( in this case blockchain ) is valuable whereas BTC is valuable because it ’s the “ money ” replacer 

 LOL .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is doing nothing but surfing the wave .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ;   The issue for Bitcoin long term is why ca n't ETH be digital gold .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 One problem Ethereum has for digital gold is that its blockchain is so massive and bloated that its difficult to synchronize from scratch .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`if you did your homework , you would understand that smart contracts on a blockchain is a stupid idea when that blockchain wants to be a store of value as well . 

 Ether wants to be everything .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 3 years ago I thought ETH classic would pick that up .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum needs to decide what it wants to do and do it well .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 ETH started as oil for smart contracts and Vitalik said himself that Bitcoiners should use Ethereum because it was not trying to beat Bitcoin .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`By pivoting ETH into a SOV , you are pumping the price and the cost of running smart contracts .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 If matic is successful in doing that magic secure L2 to L2 transaction , it will effectively kill Ethereum .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Making L2 better makes Ethereum better 

 The question at hand is : Is it possible to move tokens from Matic to Loopring ?`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 DEXs can not be run on a single blockchain like Ethereum because of arb bots bloating the blocks .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Its a market offer because of Ethereum high fees .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`yea but you do n't need ETH to use sidechains .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`ETH started as a security so be careful what you wished for .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`so you want a quick and dirty HF ? 

 Do you understand the work needed to upgrade the ETH network ?`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`ETH maxis think L2 will solve everything .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 remember when AWS killed Parler because of Trump ? 

 with this , AWS will have tremendous leverage on Ethereum and future regulations .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Its about the political power of being able to shut down ETH nodes specifically or control txs at that level . 

 And regulations will allow them to exert political pressure .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 If AWS takes too much market share , what will happen when KYC regulations from Gensler come in and they see Ethereum as a giant mixer which is impossible to know who trades what and who owns what ?`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`the problem of ETH is that there is a HUGE premine .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; If Vitalik had actually had to mine ETH that he has , he would n't be so against miners , he premined it for himself and is now staking it to earn interest .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 If SEC says XRP is not a security , companies will stop issuing shares and will mint their own tokens XRP / ETH style .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`they do n't have a stake in ETH anymore except getting the most money out of it before POS .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; That ’s effectively what they ’ve done with ETH 

 Lets be honest here .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`the SEC said the currently mined ETH are not securities .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`That 's why the ETH Foundation is trying to kill the miners with 1559`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`man the stake pool owns the ETH .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`Bitcoin is gold 2.0 , ETH is an utility token for smart contracts .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`And the more 32 ETH multiples you have , the more new tokens will be generated by staking .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`please explain to us how RocketPool is trustless ? 

 At the end of the day , only 1 private key controls the 32 ETH on the staking node .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`You will see once Ethereum is POS and the first contentious hard fork creates political havoc .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`

 the more useless ETH becomes for normal people .`
Mordan,favor,Ethereum,`good luck for ETH trying to be a store of value for its stakers .`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`But in all seriousness , I want ETH to fly .`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`I do n’t consider eth to be an alt coin per se , but I agree BTC is large and in charge .`

walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`I repeat : Moon is now on Ethereum mainnet`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Now let ’s get eth to 10k`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum , on the other hand , has smart contracts , is the foundation to many other coins ( including DeFi ) , and has eth 2.0 development working towards staking , lower gas fees and the ability to support higher volume through sharding .`

walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`The hard fork includes necessary components for live swapping Ethereum from a proof - of - work ( PoW ) blockchain to a proof - of - stake ( PoS ) chain in what is generally referred to as the Eth 2.0 or Serenity overhaul .`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`ETH really hit 2k , let ’s gooooo`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Did I hear 3k , eth ?`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Alright let ’s hit 60k for BTC and 3k for ETH`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`* send me one eth , I ’ll send you two * ^/s`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Ca n’t believe I just bought ETH at * * $ 700 * * by setting a limit buy`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Make sure you got ETH / BTC`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`When do we think institutions will start buying Ethereum and not just Bitcoin ?`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`I do n’t see ETH 2.0 failing , and there are multiple upgrades working toward the completion of 2.0 for reduced fees and greater transactions .`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Amazon adding eth support for AWS is such a neat thing .`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`That ’s what optimistic rollup is going to fix as part of eth 2.0`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`I feel that it is time for ETH to hit 2k`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s get ETH to those numbers`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Raise your hand if you ’re watching your btc / eth gains go up`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s not even a question whether ETH is going to break through 2k — it ’s happening`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Who was the dude who made a post saying he ’d give his ~50k moons away if ETH hit 2k this year 🤣`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`With all the btc / eth excitement , I did n’t realize GRT was back over $ 2`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`I predict ETH will bust out to 2k by hump day`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`C’m on ETH , let ’s get to that dominance to lucky number 13`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`ETH 2k EOD , let ’s go !`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`When ETH finally blows past 2k like BTC blew past 50k , that will be the day .`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`What ’s up with all the random coins being shilled .. let me shill you the OG ’s - * * BTC & amp ; ETH *`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`I ’ll give an award to whoever can push ETH to 2k`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`That ’s why I HODL BTC / ETH`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`- ETH will scale this month with Optimistic rollups 

 - ETH will go from no supply cap to a deflationary asset thanks to EIP1559`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`ETH dominance creeping back up around 12 % , let ’s get to 13 %`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`EIP-1559 will burn transaction fees and will allow eth to have a deflationary supply , which adds to the scarcity of ether .`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go eth baby`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Let ’s go eth !`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`We all know deep down that ETH will reach BTC prices`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Imagine when folks realize ETH is the real play , not ETC`
walkinthepark01,favor,Ethereum,`Now that eth has hit 4k , 

 ADA will hit $ 2 , then $ 3`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`I really down like the wording here : 

 & gt ; The DoS issue can be used to crash all Geth nodes during block processing , the effects of _ _ which would be that a major part of the Ethereum network went offline .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 I ’d rather see it written as : 

 & gt ; The DoS issue can be used to crash all Geth nodes during block processing , which would result in a major part of the Ethereum network going offline .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Etheruem and Ethereum 2.0 will have the same Eth token over the long run .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 During Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 ( where we are now ) , you lock your Eth in a contract and your balance appears on the new Ethereum 2.0 network and ca n’t be retrieved - they are effectively locked off from the Etheruem 1.0 network .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 After Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1.5 , you will be able to reclaim those tokens and we should then see Ethereum 2.0 and Ethereum 1.0 networks merge and there will only be a single Eth token .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 I like that people who held Ethereum had a difficult decision between staking , making money in DeFi , etc ...`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`And I disagree that a value transfer coin has much value in its own and is better as a layer2 network on top of a network like Ethereum ( or any smart contract network - maybe integrated with polkadot ) .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum 2.0 is an optimization but is n’t required for Ethereum to be adopted by its target audience , so no ones “ blocked ” on it going live with Phase 1 .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Anyone can develop new language support for Ethereum as well without having to make any changes in the Ethereum code base or protocol .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 As people start wanting more languages , they will be made available for Ethereum smart contract development , it just turns out that language choice is n’t the biggest issue with developing smart contracts .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Actually , one more correction to the person you replied to : 

 Ethereum always planned to operate in Proof of Stake , but the research team had to invent new technology to make it possible to have Proof of Stake that did n’t suffer from the known attack vectors such as “ nothing at stake ” and did n’t have to rely on Delegated Proof of Stake which has shown time and time again to lead to a centralized service .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 They did n’t want to wait years before launching Ethereum since something like it was needed .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s not quite the same utility as ETH since Doge ca n’t power smart contracts .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`If you bought BTC and then converted that to ETH , you would need to calculate how much the BTC you converted appreciated in value and report that to the IRS .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`ADA is an interesting concept , but I ’m not sure it can outshine Ethereum though I ’m sure it will find a niche .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`The hosting questions should really just be considered when deciding if Ethereum is decentralized enough for you to trust that miners wo n’t interfere with your business .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 When you choose to build something in a blockchain , it ’s usually because there are clear benefits for your services to be in an open ecosystem such as tie - ins with other smart contracts , allowing your users to buy / sell / trade outside of a walled garden , provable scarcity , auditable systems without trust , etc ... 

 Trying to build some of these on a centralized system is quite a bit of work and the Ethereum blockchain already enables these for you .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 If I decide I want privacy on Ethereum , there are tools I can use to have that privacy ,   and regardless of whether I use privacy tools on Ethereum or I use a privacy - based blockchain , the US government will eventually force me to disclose what was in those transactions if I ever want to interact with a traditional financial institution .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 That ’s when people should make the decision , not out of fear that the government is watching what ERC20 token they swap some ETH for or that they ’ve sent Bitcoin to an exchange .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`& gt ; Nobody is saying that people should abandon transparent cryptocurrencies .... 

 Please read your title and see that it says people should stop using Bitcoin and Ethereum if they are worried about the new regulations and WhatsApp data sharing .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 This discussion is clearly going nowhere and I feel I ’ve pointed out to anyone reading this that they do n’t need to make a knee - jerk reaction and “ stop using Bitcoin and Ethereum ” if they are worried about other privacy issues happening in the world .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`You can always use Loopring which is an Ethereum layer2 if you want to trade tokens with really low fees .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Your best bet for something like this is to get major non - profits ( like the EFF and ACLU ) to run these and just use a PoA network ( which is already supported in enterprise Ethereum networks ) .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 You may see your portfolio increase due to the wild , irrational market that is crypto , but it ’s not a good long - term bet and Ethereum classic has capitalized on people not understanding the difference in the past .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`One possibility is that minting in NFT requires storing data , and data storage is expensive on Ethereum since it means every node has to store this data .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`The main difference is that the Bitcoin community says high fees are good while people in Ethereum want lower fees and the ecosystem is actively building ways to do that .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is specifically not money , they call this out in the yellow paper .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Mist was the main Ethereum one and its development stopped now that popular alternatives like MetaMask exist .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 You should understand that Ethereum is a platform for decentralized finance and people are still building new things all the time .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum the blockchain is n’t about storing personal user data .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum is n’t about storing personal data of people , and it ’s a terrible place to store it even if that was the intention .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Your comment about Ethereum not being able to scale to do this is unrelated to the discussion since it is n’t aiming to do this .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum transaction data can be associated with metadata about participants , ideally through a zero - knowledge approach where the person asking the question only gets a yes / no answer ( ex : is this person over 18 ?`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 This can be done in many ways without actually storing the real data on the Ethereum blockchain .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Cardano and Algorand also had the advantage of using research done by Ethereum developers so they could implement these features immediately .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Hopefully they dig into what Ethereum researchers have invented for PoS since much of it did n’t exist pre - Ethereum , and then change their minds .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`The Ethereum DAG is used for looking up values needed to produce a block and not as the structure of the ordered transactions .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`It ’s important to remember that the Ethereum Foundation does n’t have any control of when it will come out , so they ca n’t provide a date .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 I ’m interested in hearing why you think EIP-1559 is so important to Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`It certainly has its advantages such as making gas cost bidding more predictable and stopping miners from spamming up fees , but those seem like small problems when looking at the Ethereum road map .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 In the long - run , you ’ll be able to rely on Ethereum rollup L2s ( already live in mainnet ) for very cheap , secure transfers , so I do n’t know why you ’d want to use the AVAX bridge for this scenario in the future .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Eth2 tokens are the same as Eth1 tokens , they are just locked up on the PoS network until a later Ethereum 2.0 phases .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`The two networks will either merge or the current Ethereum PoW network will become a shard connected to the beacon chain , but there will only ever be in Eth token that people can use .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Their argument is that Ethereum is n’t good for complex business logic , though they do n’t know if that ’s even needed in Miami ’s vision .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 The easiest thing for Miami to do is look into launching a Layer2 rollup network where they can offload calculations to a different network and then commit them to the main Ethereum chain ( like Loopring does ) .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 It ’s true that a single blockchain wo n’t serve the world ’s computation needs , but that is n’t Ethereum ’s strategy and they already have layer2s on mainnet .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Whatever Miami chooses , they should aim to ensure their solution integrates well with Ethereum since that ’s starting to become the standard for decentralized asset management .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Switching to another chain does n’t help if you want people to use it and have it be able to take advantage of the other economic activity on Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Though liquidity is lower than on uniswap , Loopring is a second layer on top of Ethereum so your actual trades are almost free .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`No one needs Cardano to fix Ethereum ’s scalability .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 You ’ll hear people say “ cardano will fix this ” or “ EOS will fix this ” , but any decentralized blockchain will run into few issues when / if it gets as popular as Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 The nice thing about solutions like Loopring is that your ETH never actually leaves the Ethereum Layer1 network ( it just lives in a smart contract ) and it ’s non - custodial so you ’re always in control of your coins .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Layer2s are going to be heavily utilized in an effort to scale Ethereum , so it ’s best if we all embrace them .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`At a very high level ( I do recommend searching what Gotigers811 suggested ) , Layer1 is Ethereum itself but what we can do is put Eth into a contract on Layer1 , and then sign transactions to each other on Layer2 networks ( which is their own validators much like Eth 2.0 does ) .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Using ZK - Rollup enables a lot of transactions in the Loopring network to be represented by a small amount of data on the Ethereum network - this is how Loopring can handle more transactions at a very low cost compared to Ethereum itself .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 When you hear people talk about Layer2 on Ethereum , they are n’t talking about the next “ Ethereum killer ” , but are encouraging the use of technology that can scale Ethereum today and relieve a lot of congestion caused by DeFi users .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`What people miss when shilling Cardano is that it will rely on L2 solutions just like those that already exist on Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Just like Ethereum ’s L2s , it will take time for Cardano to get any real usage thanks to Ethereum being where all the developers are building .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`You can personally sell ETH for DAI if you think ETH is going to lose value ( though we do n’t discuss price speculation here ) , but depending on where you live , that may be a taxable transaction .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`People are working on reducing fees by enabling Layer2 solutions , but the Ethereum blockchain is in high demand and people are willing to pay a lot to use it , pushing the normal users out .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Miners get rewarded from the block reward , they should n’t also get rewarded in the form of free smart contract execution - that was never an intended part of the protocol . 

 & gt ; It is not in miners interest to spam or cause damage to the network ... 

 This assumes an honest miner who is invested in Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`They made an investment in GPUs under a set of known circumstances in Ethereum , but they were fully aware that those circumstances would change over time .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 We need L2 networks offering specialized use cases while still being connected to the larger Ethereum ecosystem and relying on Ethereum to be the future economic hub .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 This is exactly what Ethereum has done through adding pre - compiles and increasing the gas limit .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 The L2 solution they will use is a state channel solution , and those exist already on Ethereum , it ’s just taking time to get people to adopt them ( Cardano will have the same adoption issue ) .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 The real question is : will Ethereum lower state storage gas fees and increase the max gas per - block to increase throughout ? 

 The answer is probably no since they do n’t want to risk centralization , and sharding+L2s seem like it will be a much safer solution and will scale just as well .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`I ca n’t even count how many times new people have entered into crypto , been sold on some now - abandoned or barely used blockchain , but decided to tell everyone how it was going to be the next “ Ethereum killer ” .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 In general , we keep this thread focused on Ethereum itself ( not the price of Eth ) , and then all blockchains can be discussed in r / cryptocurrency .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 L2 layers are already live on Ethereum , we just need more contracts ( mainly Uniswap ) to move there .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 The people in this sub ca n’t fix gas prices , and they ’re high because Ethereum is in demand and all smart contract block chains have limited capacity . 

 Layer2 networks already exist on Ethereum and we need people to adopt them .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`This is a place for Ethereum discussions and we do n’t need you adding more spam and trying to scare people into buying your coins .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`You ’ve already mentioned it in this same thread before I commented : 

 & gt ; Ethereum network is shit , this is why everyone is going to ADA and BNB .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Using Layer2s on top of Ethereum is n’t leaving Ethereum , it ’s people using the network as it ’s been designed .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`I think hosted L2s would have changed the way developers used Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 For years , people have been coming here to scare new community members into buying some other coin and claiming Ethereum will be dead .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`People like you are who we see come in here and not be able to have meaningful technical or economic discussions , but claim that their investment is going to beat Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 There ’s little harm in buying some up and coming tokens like ADA if you think they ’ll go up in value , just make sure you do n’t spend more than you can lose ( on any of these coins , including ETH ) .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Make sure your actually sending transactions on Cardano and using smart contracts and Layer2 networks on Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 That does n’t help for sending ETH to contracts or non - Coinbase users , but it is nice when sending between friends on Coinbase .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Ethereum has its own shortcomings around fees , so I try not to judge Bitcoin too hard .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`That is why Ethereum is going to succeed long - term , it has the developers and businesses know they can get support and trust that the network will fulfill its promises .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Ethereum ’s smart contract functionality makes it far easier to implement trustless layer2 protocols ( as well as all the features we have in L1 ) .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`

 Having hard forks ( which are planned releases ) has no bearing on whether Ethereum is implemented well or is a poor foundation .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`The L2s we have already are pretty impressive , especially given how new the research on Optimistic and ZK - Rollups actually is . 

 L2 solutions are what every decentralized smart contract platform is betting on going forward so they can avoid being victims of their own success like Ethereum has been .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`When large companies think “ blockchain ” , they think Consensys and Ethereum .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`There were actual reasons for lining up identity on Ethereum - smart contracts can have access to identity information .`
o-_l_-o,favor,Ethereum,`Building on Ethereum is n’t about selling tokens , it ’s about allowing your platform to be leveraged by the larger ecosystem .`
